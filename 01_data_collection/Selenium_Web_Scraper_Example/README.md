# Example code for web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Selenium

This guide provides instructions on customizing the provided web scraping script, which uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium, to extract data from a website when no official API is available. The code is designed to download artwork images from a specific URL and store relevant data in a CSV file.


### Modifying Parameters:

1. **URL and Pagination**: The script navigates through pages of the museum's collection. To adapt this to another website, modify the `driver.get()` line inside the loop with the new base URL:
   ```python
   driver.get(f"https://example.com/page={page_number}")
   ```

2. **Total Pages and Artworks Per Page**: If the total number of pages or artworks per page is different, adjust the `total_pages` and `artworks_per_page` variables at the beginning of the script:
   ```python
   total_pages = 100  # Set to the total number of pages on the new website
   artworks_per_page = 20  # Set to the number of artworks listed on each page
   ```

3. **Image Download Path**: Change the folder where images are saved by modifying the `folder` parameter in the `download_image` function:
   ```python
   def download_image(image_url, filename, folder='new_folder_name'):
   ```

### Extracting Required Fields:

To ensure the script correctly scrapes data from the new website, you'll need to inspect the source code of the target web pages and identify the HTML elements containing the desired data.

1. **Inspect Elements**: Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible via right-click > Inspect) to examine the HTML structure. Identify the tags and attributes that contain the data you need.

2. **Modify the BeautifulSoup Selectors**: Adjust the `find()` and `find_all()` methods in the `scrape_artwork_data` function to match the HTML elements and attributes identified:
   ```python
   title = get_text_safe(artwork.find('tag_name', {'class': 'class_name'}))
   ```

   Replace `'tag_name'` and `'class_name'` with the appropriate HTML tag and class or ID based on your inspection.

3. **Handling Dynamic Content**: The script uses Selenium to handle JavaScript-rendered content. If the loading time is different or additional navigation is required (like clicking buttons), adjust the `time.sleep()` duration or add more Selenium interactions:
   ```python
   time.sleep(5)  # Adjust sleep time according to page load time
   ```

4. **Error Handling and Progress Monitoring**: The script uses a progress bar to monitor tasks. If the structure of tasks changes (more or fewer steps), modify the progress-related code to reflect these changes.

By following these steps, you can adapt the script to scrape data from different websites, ensuring you capture all necessary information efficiently and store it in an organized manner.
