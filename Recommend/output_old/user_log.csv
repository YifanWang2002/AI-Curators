1258,Lady Wearing Spectacles,American 19th Century,c. 1840,1840.0,1840.0,Oil on canvas,NGA-09d4b14d-114e-422e-8903-1657c04438fd,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/09d4b14d-114e-422e-8903-1657c04438fd/full/1686,/0/default.jpg","A poised lady gazes solemnly, captured in a traditional mid-19th century American portrait.","The artwork portrays a seated woman dressed in a dark, elegant dress with lace details and a yellow beaded necklace. Her hair is parted in the center and styled in ear-tied loops. Notably, she wears round spectacles, a sign of her intellect or status. She holds what appears to be a book or small clutch purse in her right hand, suggesting literacy or social standing. The background is sparse, with a hint of a draped curtain to the right.","This painting exhibits characteristics of American folk art from the 19th century. It has a flat, almost two-dimensional feel with minimal background detail and a strong emphasis on the subject. The use of color is restrained yet targeted to highlight certain features like the yellow necklace and the blue of her dress. The portrait embraces a straightforward representation, with little concern for perspective or depth, reflecting an idiosyncratic approach to portraiture common among self-taught artists of the period.","['American Folk Art', '19th Century', 'Portraiture', 'Flat Color Application', 'Minimal Background']","The theme of the portrait is a formal portrayal of an individual, focusing on characteristics that likely held significance in her life and status, such as her spectacles, attire, and possibly educational or literacy level, as implied by the object in her hand.","['Individuality', 'Status', 'Formality', 'Intellect', 'Literacy']","{'lady': 'A woman with a direct gaze, featured prominently, wearing spectacles and dark-colored attire with a lace collar and yellow necklace.', 'spectacles': 'The spectacles the woman wears are round and sit on the bridge of her nose, indicating a sense of refinement or intellectualism.', 'book_or_purse': ""An accessory held in the woman's hand, suggesting literacy or sophistication, depicted ambiguously as either a book or a small clutch.""}","['curtain', 'lace collar']",['American Folk Art'],"['lady', 'spectacles', 'book_or_purse', 'curtain', 'lace collar']","['American Folk', 'Portraiture', 'Flat Color', 'Individuality', 'Status', 'Formality', 'Intellect', 'Lady', 'Curtain', 'Lace Collar']"
146,Souvenir of Terracina,"Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (French, 1796-1875)","1864, reworked slightly later",1864.0,1870.0,Oil on canvas,NGA-b3550d55-0c4f-43dc-ab19-b527523718ba,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b3550d55-0c4f-43dc-ab19-b527523718ba/full/1686,/0/default.jpg",An idyllic landscape blending humans and nature in a serene atmosphere.,"The painting depicts a verdant landscape with towering trees dominating the foreground. A group of people is seen on a path, suggesting a moment of leisure or travel. Architectural structures loom in the background, hinting at human presence and cultivation amidst the natural surroundings. The sky is vast, with delicate clouds softly brushed across it.","Corot has employed a naturalistic style with a sense of immediacy that borders on the impressionistic. The brushwork is loose and sketch-like, creating an atmosphere rather than delineating precise detail. Soft light filters through the leaves, and the palette comprises muted earth tones that evoke a sense of calm. The play between light and shadow suggests the time of day might be early morning or late afternoon.","['Naturalistic', 'Loose Brushwork', 'Impressionistic Tendencies', 'Atmospheric', 'Muted Earth Tones', 'Play of Light and Shadow']","The theme of 'Souvenir of Terracina' orbits around the harmony between man and nature, with a hint of nostalgia. Corot captures a timeless moment, possibly a reflection of personal memories or an idealized representation of a pastoral life that is often romanticized in art.","['Harmony', 'Man and Nature', 'Nostalgia', 'Timeless', 'Pastoral Life', 'Romanticized']",{},"['Path', 'Architectural structures', 'Clouds']","['Realism', 'Barbizon School']","['Path', 'Architectural structures', 'Clouds']","['Naturalistic', 'Loose Brushwork', 'Atmospheric', 'Harmony', 'Man And Nature', 'Nostalgia', 'Pastoral Life', 'Romanticized', 'Path', 'Architectural Structures', 'Clouds', 'Realism', 'Barbizon School']"
