    "title": "Impressions of Leisure: Scenes from the Late 19th Century",
    "description": "This exhibition invites viewers to explore the vibrant and dynamic world of leisure as captured by renowned artists of the late 19th century. Through a selection of works, we delve into the themes of relaxation, social interaction, and the beauty of nature, as depicted in various settings. From the bustling streets of Volendam to the serene waters of Venice, each artwork offers a unique perspective on the joys of life during this period. The exhibition features notable pieces by masters such as Georges Seurat, whose studies for 'Bathers at Asni\u00e8res' reveal the artist's innovative approach to color and form. Claude Monet's 'Palazzo da Mula, Venice' transports viewers to the enchanting canals of Italy, while Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's 'Hussars' captures the lively spirit of Parisian nightlife. Additionally, the anonymous 'Harbor at Sunset' adds a touch of mystery and beauty to the collection. Together, these works create a rich tapestry of artistic expression that celebrates the leisure activities of a bygone era."
