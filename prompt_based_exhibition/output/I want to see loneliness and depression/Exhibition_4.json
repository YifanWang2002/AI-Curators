    "title": "The Struggles of Society: Artworks Depicting Beggars and Their Stories",
    "description": "This exhibition explores the poignant theme of beggars and their representation in art, showcasing works from various artists who have captured the essence of social struggles and human resilience. Through a diverse range of styles and periods, the artworks highlight the plight of the marginalized and the often-overlooked narratives of those living on the fringes of society. From Honor\u00e9 Daumier's powerful depictions of the downtrodden to the evocative imagery of Mariano Fortuny, each piece invites viewers to reflect on the socio-economic conditions that lead to such realities. The exhibition also features works by Jean-Louis Forain and George Bellows, providing a comprehensive look at how different artists interpret the theme of begging and poverty. By bringing together these significant works, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the human condition and encourage empathy towards those who are often invisible in our daily lives.",
