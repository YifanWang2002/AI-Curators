Madame Cezanne in a Yellow Chair,"Paul Cezanne (French, 1839-1906)",1888-90,1893.0,1893.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40482,France,"<p>This portrait is one in a series of four Paul Cezanne made of his wife, Emélie-Hortense Fiquet, whom he met when she worked as an artist’s model. They had a son together in 1872 and married in 1886. Technical examination suggests that Cezanne traced this image, the second in the series, from the first portrait, which he made from life. In contrast to her masklike expression, Hortense’s hands are agitated, contorted by crisscrossing brushstrokes and the dark-blue outlines Cezanne used to sketch out the forms, which remain visible in the final work.</p>

The Basket of Apples,"Paul Cezanne (French, 1839-1906)",c. 1893,1887.0,1900.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40482,France,"<p>Art, Paul Cézanne once claimed, is &quot;a harmony running parallel to nature,&quot; not an imitation of nature. In his quest for underlying structure and composition, he recognized that the artist is not bound to represent real objects in real space. Thus, <em>The Basket of Apples</em> contains one of his signature tilted tables, an impossible rectangle with no right angles. On it, a basket of apples pitches forward from a slablike base, seemingly balanced by the bottle and the tablecloth’s thick, sculptural folds. The heavy modeling, solid brushstrokes, and glowing colors give the composition a density and dynamism that a more realistic still life could never possess. This painting, one of Cézanne’s rare signed works, was part of an important exhibition urged on the artist by the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1895. Since Cézanne had spent the majority of his career painting in isolation in his native Provence, this was the first opportunity in nearly twenty years for the public to see the work of the artist who is now hailed as the father of modern painting.</p>

Painted Banner (Thangka) of Bon Deity Tonpa Shenrap,"Tibet (Western Tibet, Guge)",16th century,1500.0,1599.0,Opaque watercolor with gold on cotton,Painting,,Tibet,"<p>At the center of the thangka, Tonpa Shenrap, the founder of Bon, a pre-Buddhist religion of the Himalayas  (prior to the 8th century), presides on an elaborate throne.  He is flanked by two attendants and surrounded by a retinue of 250 enlightened beings.  He forms a group with the Four Transcendent Lords, and together they are known as the 1,000 enlightened ones.  Along the bottom register the donors of the painting preside at the left, while Bon priests – distinguishable by their hats – preside at right.   Although the artistic tradition closely follows Buddhist visual culture, as is evident in the composition and iconography, there are distinguishing features.  These include Tonpa Shenrap’s intricate crown, and details of his throne such as the dragon entwined columns, and the blue eagle (khyung) a lesser Bon deity, at the apex.</p>
<p>The Guge style of painting, named after the Guge kingdom in the Western Himalayas (11th -17th century), is evident in the way the subsidiary figures are arranged in both horizontal and vertical alignment.  Another feature is the large scrolls framing the top of the throne.</p>

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived.  The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.</p>
<p>A rich border region north of Paris, Picardy was a possession of the Burgundian Netherlands in the mid-15th century, becoming part of France in 1477. Its painters were strongly influenced by artists from the neighboring provinces of the Low Countries, among them Rogier van der Weyden and Simon Marmion.</p>

He depicted the ensemble of military artifacts in a style known as trompe l’oeil (French for “fools the eye”). With its shallow backdrop, precisely rendered objects—including swords, medals, a leather belt and buckle, a Major’s kepi (hat), and a holster—and accompanying shadows, the composition is convincing in its illusionism, drawing viewers in for a closer look.</p>

"Sandvika, Norway","Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1895,1895.0,1895.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>Claude Monet’s trip to Norway in 1895 was perhaps the most physically taxing of all his many painting campaigns. Touring the country with his stepson Jacques Hoschedé, who lived in Christiania (now Oslo), he was awestruck but initially frustrated in his search for good motifs amid the snow. Nevertheless, he painted 29 Norwegian scenes during a two-month stay. These included at least six views of Sandvika, a village near Christiania whose iron bridge may have reminded Monet of the Japanese bridge at his home in Giverny.</p>

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>

In <em>Wind-Swept Sands</em>, Chase used rapid brushstrokes to depict the dunes and vegetation, thin washes for the sky, and an overall gray tone to indicate an overcast day. Chase’s teaching method was rooted in the French Impressionist practice of painting outdoors in order to take advantage of natural light and changing weather conditions.</p>

He is presumably her music instructor, but the similarity in their ages and the presence of the bed in the background make the precise relationship of the figures tantalizingly ambiguous.</p>

The supple, translucent flesh demonstrates the interest in naturalism that blossomed in Northern Europe in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, which led artists to work increasingly “from life,” that is, from observation of models.</p>

<p>Previously attributed to an unknown Sevillian artist, this painting has recently been recognized as the work of a young Diego Velázquez. The treatment of the saint is more idealized than figures in Velázquez’s earliest work, suggesting that it may have been made after his brief visit to Madrid in 1622, where Italian paintings in the royal collection exposed him to new ways of depicting the human figure.</p>

<p>This work is the third and final version of a composition the artist began in Palestine and Jerusalem in 1869, where he could study the setting from life. It was commissioned by the London dealers Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons as the model for a print. The Art Institute’s collection also includes an <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/148402/the-shadow-of-death""> early proof of that print</a>.</p>
<p>The painting teems with symbolism. For example, the star-shaped aperture above the window recalls the light that guided the Magi to the newborn Jesus, while wood shavings and carpentry tools anticipate the instruments of his death, nails and a wooden cross. The bright red headdress in the lower-right corner foreshadows the crown of thorns he was forced to wear before his execution.</p>

Madam Pompadour,"Amedeo Modigliani (Italian, 1884-1920)",1915,1915.0,1915.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35801,Italy,"<p>Born of Jewish parents in the Italian coastal town of Leghorn, Amedeo Modigliani settled in Paris in 1906, where he developed friendships with <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/36198""> Pablo Picasso </a>, the poet Max Jacob, the sculptor <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/33735""> Constantin Brancusi</a>, and other members of the literary and artistic avant-garde, many of whom appear in his portraits. He led a notoriously bohemian life, shortened by a self-destructive use of alcohol and drugs. Modigliani produced his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Within a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms.<br>In this portrait, Modigliani's emphasis is on a strong formal structure dominated by the grid in the background and the echoing curves of the sitter's hat, shoulders, and features. There is none of the pathos often associated with his work. The artist seems instead to have invested this portrait with a note of ironic detachment, even humor, reflected in both the title of the painting (which refers to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV of France) and the expression of amused inscrutability worn by the sitter. Were painter and sitter perhaps both amused by the flamboyant hat? Modigliani's skill in rhyming forms, while at the same time keeping us visually interested and slightly off-balance, is evident throughout the picture, which resonates with the lessons of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40482""> Paul Cezanne</a>, Cubism, and African sculpture.<br>The sitter for this portrait may well have been Beatrice Hastings, an English poetess who was Modigliani's mistress at the time. Because of the artist's tendency to generalize his sitter's features, however, a comparison of this portrait with others of Hastings is inconclusive.<br>—Entry,  Margherita Andreotti, <em>Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies</em>, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 150-151.</p>

Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva with Assembly,Korea,late 16th/early 17th century,1501.0,1700.0,Ink and color on hemp cloth,Painting,,Korea,"<p>This painting of Kshitigarbha (Jijang Bosal in Korean,) flanked by the Ten Kings of Hell and guardian deities, reflects the prevalence of faith in Kshitigarbha in Korean Buddhism. Kshitigarbha is the overlord of the Buddhist underworld who has the ability to save sentient beings from hell. Whereas Buddhism enjoyed the royal patronage during the Goryeo period, it became the religion of the masses in the late Joseon period, resulting in stylistic changes in Buddhist painting. Instead of expensive gold or lapis lazuli, red and green became the main palette; more affordable materials such as paper, cotton, or hemp were chosen over silk; and depicted robes show simpler treatment with little to no decoration.</p>

Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers,"Édouard Manet (French, 1832-1883)",1865,1865.0,1865.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35577,France,"<p>For this monumental painting, Édouard Manet depicted Jesus Christ at the end of his life, beaten and awaiting crucifixion. The Roman soldiers force him to don a crown of thorns and proffer a reed “scepter” and purple cloak, all intended to ridicule him as “King of the Jews,” a title bestowed ironically by his tormenters. Manet, who painted very few religious subjects, transformed this sacred narrative into a gritty drama that marries realism with theatricality. Shown without a halo, Jesus glows against the dark background. Is he a holy being emanating divine light or a real man posing under a studio spotlight? The painting caused a scandal in its own time for precisely this ambiguity.</p>

<p>During his brief career, which ended when he was killed in the line of duty during the Franco-Prussian War, Frédéric Bazille produced about 70 paintings, 4 of them self-portraits. He created this work while sharing an apartment-studio with Claude Monet and experimenting with new painting techniques that would be central to the Impressionist movement. It was both a practice piece (in which Bazille observed and painted his reversed image as seen in a mirror) and, given his recent decision to abandon a medical career in favor of art, a professional manifesto.</p>

Lu scolded the youth for his impertinence, only to realize that he was speaking with Monju.</p>
<p>An inscription dated 1415 by the monk Godaichi Shûgaku attests to the particular affection in which Monju was held in Zen circles.

In this myth the gods, unable to defeat a powerful shape-changing demon in the form of a water buffalo, decide to create a goddess who—with their combined weapons, energy, and strength—will be able to vanquish it. Whirling her arms and brandishing her weapons, the goddess stabs the demon with her lance in one lower hand and lifts him up by the tail with another. Her right foot stands upon her trademark vehicle, shown as a snow lion in Nepal, while her left foot crushes the demon’s back. As she does so, a human form emerges from the animal’s neck.

Pillars of the Country,"Yao Shou (Chinese, 1423-1495)","Ming dynasty (1368–1644), 1494",1423.0,1495.0,Handscroll; ink and color on paper,Painting,ARTIC-37378,China,"<p>Together with those of a riverscape, rocks, flowers, and branches of cedar and bamboo, the magpie is one of six images painted by Yao Shou along the length of this handscroll. Its portrayal represents a venerable genre of painting known as “bird-and-flower,” whose finest artists had achieved extraordinary refinement and realism by the eleventh century. Yao Shou’s vision, however, was far more personal if seemingly simpler. He described the magpie almost solely in varied tonalities of black ink; the branches are accented with darker twigs and dotted leaves but possess little sense of spatiality; and the bamboo leaves are rendered in freely executed strokes of pale blue.</p>
<p>Yao Shou accompanied the magpie—as he did its companion images—with an original poem written in his characteristically elegant cursive script and signed with his courtesy name, Gongshou:</p>
<p><q>In the bright moonlight, why does the<br>magpie circle three times before<br>alighting?<br>During sunny days, it sings on the green<br>branches.<br>I also practice divination to find the place<br>where the magpie often roosts.<br>It stays on the rooftop of the old master’s<br>house, and the stars arrive late.</q></p>
<p>The title and artist’s biography combine to add poignancy to this work. “Pillars of the Country” refers to the vital role of intellectuals in supporting China’s integrity. Almost thirty years earlier, gratuitous slander had driven Yao Shou from a prestigious career in government service to retirement as a painter, calligrapher, collector, and scholar —  all pursuits of a traditional literatus. Now advanced in years, he expressed his cultivated ideals in both the willful spontaneity of his brushwork and the informed allusions in his inscription, adapting each line from that of a celebrated poem from centuries past.</p>
<p>As documented by several seals impressed on its surface, this painting once held an honored place in the collection of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95), China’s most passionate imperial collector.</p>

Madame de Pastoret and Her Son,"Jacques-Louis David (French, 1748-1825)",1791/92,1791.0,1792.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-34147,France,"<p>The volatile events of the early years of the French Revolution make it impossible to determine with certainty the date of Jacques-Louis David’s warm, fresh portrait of Adélaïde de Pastoret. They also probably account for the portrait’s unfinished state. David, a renowned Neoclassical painter, was at the time an ardent revolutionary; Madame de Pastoret was the wife of a staunch royalist. The sittings must have occurred after the birth, early in 1791, of her son, who is portrayed asleep by her side, and before her brief imprisonment during the Reign of Terror in 1792. Here David completed the stippled, almost monochromatic underpainting but did not create the stark, enamel-smooth surface that is characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even get far enough to place a needle and thread in Madame de Pastoret’s hand. Nevertheless, this large portrait of unaffected domesticity captures the youthful mother with charm as well as dignity and displays David’s skill as a portraitist. Objecting to David’s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret (who became the Marquise de Pastoret in 1817) refused the painting during the artist’s lifetime. After David’s death, she had her son, by then an adult, purchase the portrait from the artist’s estate.</p>

Having trained in Philadelphia and Paris, Cassatt ventured to Spain to study the country’s Renaissance and Baroque works and to follow the path of French avant-garde artists like Édouard Manet. Depicting the performer at a relaxed moment, far removed from the spectacle and violence of the ring, Cassatt omitted narrative detail. Instead, with a modernist sensibility, she focused on the male figure in a casual pose, employing vigorous brushwork and rich pigment to describe the bullfighter’s costume and suggest his characteristic bravado.</p>

They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

The Home of the Heron,"George Inness (American, 1825–1894)",1893,1893.0,1893.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35061,Florida,"<p>The landscape painter George Inness once explained, “The true purpose of the painter is simply to reproduce in other minds the impression which a scene has made upon him . . . to awaken an emotion.” Inness sought, particularly in his later years, to record not so much the appearance of nature as its poetry. To achieve this, he limited his subject matter to, in his words, “rivers, streams, the rippling brook, the hillside, the sky, the clouds.” For half a century, the artist captured these moisture-laden subjects in all seasons, during all hours of the day and night. First he made small, quick sketches in the field or wood, and then, in the seclusion of his studio, he used them to create the more than one thousand oils credited to him.</p>
<p>Inness completed <em>The Home of the Heron</em> near the end of his career, after he had finally achieved a degree of comfort and success. The painting is characteristic of his late work, with loosely rendered detail and dim objects that seem bathed in an almost incandescent glow. The picture’s blurred outlines, broad handling, and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the heron, masterfully evoke nature’s stillness and mystery. With more than two dozen canvases by Inness, the Art Institute has one of the most comprehensive collections of the painter’s work.</p>

The Irish Question,"De Scott Evans (American, 1847-1898)",1880s,1880.0,1889.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-52802,United States,"<p>A seemingly uncomplicated representation of two potatoes suspended by a string against a wood panel, <em>The Irish Question</em> is an unusual and striking trompe l’oeil painting that raises numerous questions. The title may refer to the troubled status of the Irish in the late 19th century; the hanging potatoes inflect this allusion with either ominous overtones or a dark sense of humor. Illusionistic paintings such as <em>The Irish Question</em> offer an enjoyable form of visual deception, and the pseudonymous signature “S.S. David” suggests that De Scott Evans relished the opportunity to puzzle his viewers on many levels.</p>
","This highly realistic still life is an example of a trompe l’oeil painting, French for “fools the eye.” The potatoes seem to come off the canvas, but they also are symbolic, alluding to the great wave of Irish immigrants in the 1800s; while the public had cocerns about their religion and culture, industry saw them as a source of cheap labor.",30.5 × 25.4 cm (12 × 10 in.),ARTIC-6754947f-4ccf-b3ff-41ee-45b738534769,https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/6754947f-4ccf-b3ff-41ee-45b738534769/full/max/0/default.jpg

In <em>The Artist in His Studio</em>, Whistler stares out at the viewer with palette and paintbrush in hand, surrounded by works from his collection: three Japanese scrolls hang on the wall and Chinese porcelain adorns shelves on the left. He applied thin layers of paint in muted tones to evoke the flattened appearance of Japanese woodblock prints. The composition also recalls the work of the Spanish Baroque master, Diego Velázquez. Whistler harmonized Western and Eastern artistic elements, placing himself at the center of such an enterprise.</p>

Recognizing this, his patron Paul-Antoine Berard commissioned the artist to paint a number of portraits of his four children, in addition to likenesses of himself and his wife. Here, Renoir portrayed Lucie, Berard’s youngest and one of the artist’s favorite models, as the picture of innocence at three years old. Her small hands, positioned rather formally at her sides, lack the accessories, like toys and books, found in some other of Renoir’s portraits of children; her white dress and subtle smile invoke a serene but fleeting moment of youth.</p>

The first painting shows Jerome’s dream of being punished by a heavenly council for preferring ancient Greek and Roman texts to the Christian Bible. In the second painting, Saint Augustine sits at his desk composing a eulogy for Jerome when he is interrupted by a vision of the scholar-saint accompanied by John the Baptist, who praises Jerome as his equal. Matteo di Giovanni hinted at this connection in The Dream of St. Jerome by including a scene of baptism in the archway above Jerome’s head. Such cross-references between artworks and texts are a hallmark of 15th-century Italian painting and served to engage the viewer in active, contemplative looking.</p>

Master Schaum,"Jacob Eichholtz (American, 1776-1842)",1808–10,1808.0,1810.0,Oil on yellow poplar panel,Painting,ARTIC-43630,Lancaster,"<p>Working as a coppersmith in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Jacob Eichholtz aspired to be a portraitist, eventually giving up his metalwork business to focus on painting by 1811. Despite having essentially no formal training in the medium, Eichholtz progressed quickly, becoming one of the leading portrait painters in Philadelphia and nearby areas. These portraits of the family of Benjamin Schaum (<a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61148/mr-benjamin-schaum"">1980.742</a>, <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61151/mrs-benjamin-schaum-anna-maria-heckensweiler"">1980.743</a>, and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64686/miss-schaum"">1980.745</a>), a fellow resident and coppersmith in Lancaster, are examples of the artist’s early style. Eichholtz first mastered small, profile portraits like these, typically executed on wooden panels. Later he developed a more sophisticated handling of the figure, rendering larger-scale compositions on canvas of his sitters in three-quarter views.</p>

Francisco de Goya captured the scene’s wintry atmosphere with barren trees, large swaths of cool grays and whites, and diagonal brushstrokes that convey rapid snowfall. This small painting is one of a series of studies Goya created for monumental tapestries depicting the four seasons, commissioned for a dining hall at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Spain. The image would have been scaled up to life-size and then manufactured by weavers in Spain’s Royal Tapestry Factory.</p>

After escaping from prison, El Maragato spent two months stealing food, guns, and money before trying to take Friar Pedro and other innocent people hostage. The friar outsmarted the bandit, however, seizing his gun, shooting him in the thigh as he tried to flee, and finally tying him up. This story was extremely popular in the early 19th century and Spanish artists memorialized it in images, poems, and songs.</p>

Cabin in the Cotton,"Horace Pippin (American, 1888-1946)",c. 1931–37,1931.0,1937.0,Oil on cotton mounted on Masonite,Painting,ARTIC-37451,United States,"<p>Constructed of dense, thick layers of paint, <em>Cabin in the Cotton</em> exemplifies the tactile and vivid style of selftaught artist Horace Pippin. At a southern homestead, an older woman cares for a young child. Beyond, an expansive field of cotton evokes the hard labor, likely that of family members, required to harvest the crop. Pippin turned to painting as a mode of rehabilitation after injuring his arm while serving in World War I. Born in Pennsylvania, the artist’s interpretation of cotton fields drew upon a visit to South Carolina with his regiment in 1917. Popular culture also may have informed his work: “Cabin in the Cotton” was the title of both a song and a film in the 1930s. On view in a shoe repair shop outside Philadelphia in 1937, the composition caught the attention of artists, critics, and gallerists, winning Pippin wide acclaim and furthering his career.</p>

This is one of two paintings of life-size, rustic ﬁgures that Piazetta made for his patron, Field Marshall Johann Matthias von der Schulenberg. Their meaning remains mysterious. The half-naked boy holding a basket of grapes has been interpreted as the infant Bacchus, the god of wine, although Piazzetta made no reference in his description of the work to a symbolic meaning. The artist was probably responding to his patron’s taste for pastoral scenes, a genre that appealed to middle- and upper-class city dwellers for its idealized views of rural life.</p>

Water Lilies,"Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1906,1906.0,1906.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>“One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all,” said Claude Monet, referring to his late masterpieces, the water landscapes that he produced at his home in Giverny between 1897 and his death in 1926. These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be"">water-lily series</a> (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted <em>Water Lilies</em>, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.</p>

The subject of this portrait, Norfolk gentleman Thomas Bulwer, likely hired Soest because of the painter’s ability to convey a sitter’s authority with directness and simplicity. Here, Soest depicted Bulwer clutching a scroll to signal his intellectual interests and influence. Likewise, the subject’s hand poised on the chair’s armrest suggests that he is about to rise, an indication of his active nature. The inscription and date, which were uncovered during cleaning, were added in the 18th century.</p>

Édouard Manet exhibited them together in 1872, along with paintings of an absinthe drinker and a ragpicker, under the collective title <em>Philosophers</em>. The beggars of Paris, nonconformist types under threat from government schemes intended to drive them out of the city, held a particular fascination for Realist artists and writers. By setting his large-scale figures against empty, dark backgrounds, Manet added to their portraitlike, indeed heroic, presence.

Here the Virgin supports the Child on a cushion that appears to rest on the edge of the picture’s frame, as though revealing the infant to the viewer through a window opening. Van der Weyden used elements such as the gems decorating the Virgin’s dress, her pearl-studded circlet, and the thronelike associations of the rich red velvet hanging behind her to characterize her as the queen of heaven. At the same time, by depicting her nurturing her infant, the artist emphasized Christ’s human nature and the Virgin’s role as an intercessor for mankind.</p>

A Monumental Portrait of a Monkey,"India (Rajasthan, Mewar, Udaipur, attributed to the “Stipple Master” (active c. 1692-c. 1715))",c. 1705–1710,1700.0,1715.0,Opaque watercolor and gold on paper,Painting,,India,"<p>Except for depictions of the monkey-god Hanuman, monkeys are rarely the subject of portraits in India. In this monumental portrait, therefore, we are looking not only at an unusual subject matter but also at a study of an extraordinary simian: one with human features complete with a beard, pale eyes, and long, slender hands. The inscription on the back of this work, written in Devanagari, states that the monkey is named Husaini and “comes from” Nawab Davad (or Daud) Khan. This name most likely refers to Daud Khan Panni, a powerful nobleman and a <em>faujdar</em> (a military commander and territorial administrator) who served the Mughal emperors from Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) through Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713–19), in various parts of India. The painting has been dated to 1705/10 and is attributed to the anonymous artist now called the Stipple Master. Working in tandem with his patron Maharana Amar Singh II of Mewar (r. 1698–1710), this artist was the initiator of a new painting style in Mewar in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. A group of about forty-six paintings, including the present work, has now been attributed to this artist-patron duo.</p>

The boat bringing the knight from Armida’s island has just deposited him on the coast of Palestine. The magician of Ascalon uses Rinaldo’s shield to conjure the heroic deeds of his ancestors, urging him to live up to their legacy. In contrast to earlier canvases in the sequence, the young knight appears focused on his mission. In his choice to return to battle, the figure of Rinaldo would have served as a positive example of civic duty for the family who commissioned these decorations.</p>

The Five Virtues,"Ren Yi (Chinese, 1840-1895)","Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1895",1890.0,1900.0,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Painting,ARTIC-20727,China,"<p>Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called  Shanghai School.  Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.</p>
<p>These five pairs of birds represent the Five Cardinal Relationships, following the Neo-Confucian principle that strict and proper implementation of hierarchy among different groups achieves social harmony. Above, a pair of long-tailed phoenixes roosting in the branches of a Wutong tree represents the preeminent relationship: a ruler and his subjects. Emerging from behind are two cranes, who, more commonly associated with longevity, represent filial piety. Perched above the cranes, a pair of orioles signifies the relationship between older and younger siblings. Marital loyalty is embodied in the pair of ducks swimming in the water below, and friendship is captured in the jovial interaction of two wagtails. The artist’s choice of such an orthodox subject revealed his firm belief in the traditional values of Chinese society.</p>

The Crucifixion,"Francisco de Zurbarán (Spanish, 1598-1664)",1627,1627.0,1627.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-42406,Spain,"<p>Beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church clarified and reaffirmed its doctrine and practices in an effort to combat the impact of the Protestant Reformation. This effort, known as the Counter-Reformation, recognized the educational and inspirational value of visual images and required artists to work in a style that favored clarity and dramatic fervor.</p>
<p>In 1627 Francisco de Zurbarán, then living and working in the provincial Spanish town of Llerena, painted this <em>Crucifixion</em> for the monastery of San Pablo el Real in prosperous Seville. In the dimly lit sacristy where it was installed, the image of Christ awed the faithful. A later commentator noted that it appeared to be a sculpture rather than a painting. Zurbarán envisioned the crucified Christ suspended outside of time and place. Conforming to Counter-Reformation dictates, the artist depicted the event occurring not in a crowd but in isolation. Emerging from a dark background, the austere figure has been both idealized in its quiet, graceful beauty and elegant rendering and humanized by the individualized face and insistent realism. Strong light picks out anatomical detail, the delicate folds of the white loincloth, and a curled scrap of paper at the base of the cross on which the artist’s name and the date of the painting are inscribed.</p>

The few surviving panel paintings, as well as illuminated manuscripts, from this region are often characterized by an earthy realism. Here the artist was equally interested in the hostile reactions of the crowd as he was in giving poignancy to the figure of Christ, whom the Roman governor Pontius Pilate presents to the people for judgment.</p>

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>

Cupid Chastised,"Bartolomeo Manfredi (Italian, 1582-1622)",1613,1613.0,1613.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-41483,Italy,"<p>Following the example of the revolutionary early seventeenth-century artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Bartolomeo Manfredi chose to depict ordinary individuals in his scenes from the Bible and Greek and Roman mythology. Caravaggio had demonstrated to Manfredi and an entire generation of European artists that such lofty themes could be transformed into events experienced by ordinary people. Employing dramatic lighting and locating the action directly before the viewer, these artists were able to endow their narratives with great immediacy and power.</p>
<p><em>Cupid Chastised</em> depicts a moment of high drama: Mars, the god of war, beats Cupid for having caused his affair with Venus, the goddess of love, which exposed him to the derision and outrage of the other gods. Venus implores him in vain to desist. Surrounded by darkness, the three figures are boldly illuminated from the left, intensifying the dynamism and impact of the composition. The sheer physicality of the figures — the crouching Venus, whose broadly realized face strays from the classical ideal; the powerful Mars, whose musculature and brilliant red drapery seem to pulsate with fury; and Cupid, whose naked flesh and recumbent position render him particularly vulnerable—conveys the violent discord of the scene. On one level a tale of domestic disturbance, the story also symbolizes the eternal conflict between love and war.</p>

Dismantled by the early 19th century, Fra Angelico’s altarpiece had as its focal point a large central panel representing the Virgin and Child with saints; below this a predella featured episodes from the lives of the Medici patrons, Saints Cosmas (Cosimo’s namesake) and Damian. At the sides, set into the uprights of the frame, were 10 separate saints standing on clouds. <em>Saint Anthony Abbot</em> would have been one of these; a fourth-century Egyptian hermit, the saint was considered the founder of monasticism.</p>

Corot almost never exhibited these studies of the human form, preferring instead to publicize the idyllic landscapes that were his specialty. To emphasize the private nature of <em>Interrupted Reading</em>, Corot enclosed his model within the protective environment of the artist’s studio. The mood of the painting is introspective and somewhat melancholic, the very essence of the Romantic sensibility. The muse-like image of a woman reading a book was a popular one in nineteenth-century art, but Corot chose to show his model pausing, looking up from this activity. Having spent a number of years in Italy and being a lover of everything Italian, the artist often furnished his models with Italianate costumes such as the one worn here. Whereas Corot’s subject matter is traditional, his technique is not. With direct and bold brushwork, he explored the human form as a construction of masses that support and balance one another. This broad handling is complemented by the artist’s obvious delight in detail—the ribbon in the model’s hair, the delicate earrings, the deep folds in the skirt. Here he combined a profound sense of formal structure with the dreamy softness and intimacy that characterize his most famous landscapes.</p>

Mandarin Ducks and Lotus,"Ren Yi (Chinese, 1840-1895)","Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1892",1840.0,1895.0,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Painting,ARTIC-20727,China,"<p>Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called  Shanghai School.  Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This painting represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.</p>
<p>Although his inscription states that Ren Yi executed this work in the winter “with a frozen ink stone,” he clearly depicted an early summer scene. Four large lotus leaves, brushed with wet-ink washes, overpower a pair of young, delicate blossoms. The aquatic lotus emerges with pristine beauty from murky water and thereby carries enduring associations with Buddhist beliefs in purity and rebirth. Above the lotus, partially camouflaged by wind-swept reeds, swims a pair of mandarin ducks—traditional symbols of marital bliss and fidelity. Painted with sharp, quick brush strokes, this engaging depiction of the young couple suggests an intimacy appropriate for lifelong partners.</p>

Paris wears the garb of a contemporary knight rather than classical dress, a choice that emphasizes the enduring relevance of his moral crossroads as well as, through contrast, the nudity of the goddesses. His sleeping pose and the painting’s inscription, <em>PARIS / TRA(U)M</em> (“dream of Paris,” on the slip of paper attached to the tree), indicate that he is in the midst of a dream vision, a poetic device carried over from medieval allegory and used to foreshadow future events in a narrative. Here, these include the departure of Paris and Helen by boat in the middle distance, the catalyst for the Trojan War.</p>

<p>&quot;Details in the pictures must be elaborated only enough fully to reproduce the impression that the artist wishes to reproduce. When [there are more details], the impression is weakened or lost, and we see simply an array of external things which may be cleverly painted and may look very real, but which do not make an artistic painting. . . . The one is poetic truth, the other is scientific truth; the former is aesthetic, the latter is analytic.&quot;</p>
<p>In the course of his lengthy career, Inness increasingly eschewed precision of detail in his paintings, conveying mood and emotion through richness of tone and broadness of handling. He first visited Florida about 1890, and he subsequently established a house and studio in Tarpon Springs, where he executed this painting. In a pink-and-blue morning light, a lone man studies a cluster of buildings in the middle distance. Through blurred outlines and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the figure, Inness masterfully evoked the brightening day and peaceful mood of this moment.</p>

The &quot;bamboo stove&quot; —a carrying case that contained a ceramic kettle used for heating water—was central to the process of tea preparation. This ingenious device, fanned by a servant in the center of this painting, was the subject of a poem by Wu Kuan (1435-1504), a close friend of Tang Yin. In this composition, Wu appears on a low platform with a teapot and a scroll by his side. He shared the tea ceremony with a Buddhist monk, while another servant draws fresh water from a nearby stream.</p>
<p>Five years after Wu Kuan's death, Tang Yin executed this delicate vignette in the writer's memory. The first colophon was written by Zhu Yunming (1461-1527), a famous poet and calligrapher who exchanged tea-related verses with Mr. Wu. Such commemorative paintings provide poignant records of Chinese intellectual and cultured society.</p>

He was one of the earliest American artists to do so, and his compositions, including <em>Bar-room Scene</em>, were rich in narrative and humor and engaged with the complex cultural, political, and racial circumstances that defined antebellum society. Here Mount portrayed a boisterous group of patrons in a country tavern. The seated men encourage the drunken dance of the central figure, whose tattered clothes and inebriated state suggest a less fortunate position.

Woman and Child at the Well,"Camille Pissarro (French, 1830-1903)",1882,1882.0,1882.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36211,France,"<p>By the 1880s, Camille Pissarro, like most of his Impressionist colleagues, sought an alternative to the style he had employed over the previous decade, deciding to focus on figures rather than landscapes. Of the 36 paintings he showed at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in the spring of 1882, 27 were figural. Woman and Child at the Well is one of a series of works depicting peasant girls taking a break from their chores, their poses and gestures suggesting narratives that remain ambiguous. As the model for the boy in this composition, Pissarro used his fourth son, Ludovic-Rodolphe, who was four years old at the time.</p>

Croquet Scene,"Winslow Homer (American, 1836–1910)",1866,1866.0,1866.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-34988,United States,"<p>One of America’s foremost painters, Winslow Homer began his career as an illustrator during the Civil War. In the late 1860s, he turned his acute observational and technical skills toward oil painting, depicting figures bathed in sunlight out-of-doors. These early paintings, often executed in series, feature scenes of upper-class leisure pursuits—in this case, women and men competing with one another in the popular sport of croquet, which had recently been introduced to the United States from the British Isles. In <em>Croquet Scene</em>, one of five paintings Homer completed on the subject, progress on “the grand round” seems fairly advanced. The crouching male figure positions the ball belonging to the woman dressed in red. She is about to croquet (or “send up the country”) another ball, probably belonging to the woman in the left foreground, who shields her eyes against the bright afternoon sun. Notable for its bold patterning, strong contours, and brilliant light effects, the painting epitomizes the spirit of a breezy summer afternoon.</p>

In <em>Brooklyn Bridge</em> he recorded one of the greatest icons of modernity. Completed in 1883, this impressive structure was still the longest suspension bridge in the world when Ranger painted it sixteen years later. Yet instead of emphasizing its massive scale or modern construction the artist produced a fairly traditional view, integrating the bridge into the landscape. The painting displays a rich luminosity through Ranger’s method of layering applications of paint and using transparent glazes.</p>

<p>The inscription at the top of this painting is a quotation from the Goyuigo, a set of instructions believed to have been prepared by Kukai for his disciples. In the passage, Kukai describes a dream he had as a child in which he was carried aloft on an eight-petaled lotus flower to a heavenly realm where he conversed with various Buddhas. The practice of depicting religious leaders as children during miraculous moments in their lives would have been keenly reassuring to Buddhist devotees.</p>

The sights and experiences from this six-month journey fueled the rest of his career, lending his canvases an illusion of accuracy that his less-traveled competitors lacked. The artist expressed in his journals from abroad his admiration for Arab culture, even characterizing it as superior to that of post-revolutionary France. Nevertheless, in paintings like this he catered to violent European fantasies about the Arab world. Having never witnessed a lion hunt, Delacroix skillfully synthesized studies of landscapes, Islamic costume, and zoo animals to bring this narrative to life with theatrical intensity.</p>

Both pastels retain their original Rococo-style frames. They may have been carved by the Boston cratsman John Welch, who created many of Copley's Rococo frames, the type the artist used most frequently for his American portraits. The frame on <em>Mrs. Henry Hill</em> was gilded, as this was generally appropriate for the Rococo style; however, recent scholarship has revealed that a few Copley frames, like that of <em>Henry Hill</em>, were painted black. Thus, these portraits present two different ways that Copley's frames might have been finished.</p>

Even though they take place at different times in the story, the selected episodes are set in one continuous landscape. On the far right, the baby Genji is presented to his father, the emperor, for the first time. Across the bottom of the left screen, court ladies argue about which season is the most beautiful. Above, in the upper left corner, Genji and his love, Lady Murasaki, share an intimate moment in front of a charcoal brazier. The painter may have chosen these scenes fo their felicitous overtones. The overall character of the screens suggests that they were intended to be part of a bride’s wedding trousseau, which would accompany her to her new home.</p>

This intimate work was painted for the Estes and adorned the oratory chapel of their palace. In the painting, Saint Luke draws the Virgin and Child while Saint Joseph watches unobtrusively from a doorway. As in many Renaissance works, Christ appears agitated—seemingly possessing foreknowledge of his death. He may be reacting to the spearlike yarnwinder, an attribute of the Three Fates and, consequently, a traditional symbol of death.</p>
<p>After leaving the Estes, the painting came into the possession, successively, of two Roman cardinals, two Roman princes, the English Duke of Westminster, Baron Alfred de Rothschild, and the Earl of Carnavon, who famously paid for the excavation of the tomb of King Tutankhamen.</p>

Traditionally, the lily is a symbol of the angel Gabriel, and Mary’s downcast eyes and humble stance imply that she has received his divine message. Hitchcock spent much of his life in Holland, and his work synthesizes elements of several European art movements. The choice of a religious subject, the unusual composition, and his interest in the effects of sunlight and shadow reflect the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, the Symbolists, and the Impressionists on Hitchcock’s work.</p>

A Revolutionary War hero who served as secretary of war during Thomas Jefferson’s two presidential terms (1801–09), Dearborn continued his service as senior major-general in the 1812 campaign. This work is one of several likenesses Stuart executed of American<br>military and political men, among them his well-known depictions of George Washington. Stuart painted directly on the panel or canvas over the course of several sittings, capturing the new country’s fervent nationalism in skillful, vigorous portraits.</p>

Eakins’s portrait of the journalist is informed by Fitzgerald’s open-minded opinions, his appreciation of diverse art forms, and his commitment to intellectual life. Comfortably seated in his book-lined library, Fitzgerald is portrayed as a genteel man who enjoys a leisurely, yet contemplative lifestyle. With an open book in his lap, he thoughtfully gazes into the distance, peacefully lost in the realm of ideas.</p>

Like many 19th-century Western European artists, he was drawn to the Middle East by the region’s perceived exoticism and its ancient histories. The identity of the woman who posed in Cairo for this full-length figure study is not known. She assumes a complicated posture, placing her weight on her right foot while twisting her upper body to the left. Instead of using the bravura painterly style of swift, visible brushstrokes that characterizes his society portraits, Sargent returned to his academic training, carefully modeling the human form and a range of flesh tones. <em>Life Study</em> was widely exhibited, including at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.</p>

Giordano’s artistic studies informed this monumental depiction of the myth of the founding of Rome. The Romans, plagued by a shortage of brides, invited the neighboring Sabines to a festival and then violently kidnapped their young women. Using the rapid, bold brushwork that earned him the nickname <em>Luca fa presto</em> (Luca paints quickly), Giordano wove vivid gestures and compositional inspiration from earlier treatments of the subject into one of his most theatrical and geometrically complex works.</p>

The stoic dancer in the foreground, chin up and eyes downcast, absorbs the penetrating gaze of one large man while another looms just behind her, so close that his black top hat overlaps with her orange headdress. In 19th-century Paris, male abonnés (season ticket holders) had special access to a back room where they could socialize while watching the ballerinas warm up. Many took advantage of this privilege to sexually exploit the young dancers, who were well aware that their careers depended upon the good favor of this donor class.</p>

Broad horizontal bands of blues and gray suggest sky, ocean, and sand, with dabs of thin pigment giving economical, yet expressive form to around a dozen figures on the windswept beach. Whistler dedicated much of his artistic practice to capturing the mood and color harmonies of marine scenes. <em>Coast Scene, Bathers</em> was painted en plein air, a practice to which the artist returned in the 1880s. It marked a distinctive shift from his studio-produced <em>Nocturnes</em> of the previous decade.</p>

Attracted to the region’s landscape and peasant communities, the artist specialized in scenes featuring women in traditional dress set among voluptuous, blooming flowers. Here, Hitchcock revised the environment behind the Dutch flower seller, editing out other houses nearby in favor of a bucolic vista. Although he employed academic techniques such as fine modeling of his figures, Hitchcock nevertheless earned a reputation as a daring colorist for the brilliant hues and open brushwork that likewise characterize his compositions.</p>

Weary of the East Coast, the artist spent 18 months in the Southwest in 1918–19, believing that he could find rejuvenation in nature. Here, thick black lines define the Southwestern landscape, which he saw as alive with expressive potential. He wrote to Alfred Stieglitz, “I like the country very well, for it is big and clean and true, and there is nothing dirty standing between one and the sunlight, as there is in the east.” Like many artists who lived in New England at this time, he pictured the Southwest as uninhabited and unspoiled, overlooking the centuries of civilizations in the region.</p>

<p>このような構図はしばしば「百花図」と称され、その内「伊年」印付きのものが、17世紀頃の制作の中に数多く存在する。この印は、俵屋宗達（活動期1602-1640頃）を継承し、京都や金沢で活躍した絵師たちによって使われた。このような新しい装飾的な構図は、当時の将軍や大名たちの間で植物への関心が高まったことに関係していよう。</p>

Compositions such as this are known in Japanese as <em>hyakkazu</em> (multitude of ﬂowers), and dozens remain from the seventeenth century that are impressed with the seal reading “I’nen,” which was used by the followers of Tawaraya Sotatsu (active 1602–c. 1640) in Kyoto and Kanazawa. This new type of decorative composition coincided with an explosion of interest in botany among the shogun and regional warlords that reached all levels of society in the Edo period (1615–1868).</p>
<p>The right screen features thick-stemmed hollyhocks, roses, chrysanthemums, bushclover, pampas grass, ﬁeld horsetail shoots, dandelions, and diminutive violets. The left screen contains sorghum, amaranthus, delicate blossoming pinks, cockscombs, poppies, thistle, and begonias. Close to the bottom edge are eggplants. The artists who specialized in screens such as this did not limit themselves to the ﬂowers and grasses mentioned in classical court poetry, but were the ﬁrst to include varieties of vegetables in their compositions.</p>

Quidor’s <em>Rip Van Winkle</em> depicts the moment that Rip, awake after his 20-year sleep in the Catskill Mountains, confronts the suspicious townsfolk who do not recognize their long-lost neighbor. Unlike many portrayals of Rip Van Winkle that emphasize his age and confusion, Quidor’s version casts Rip as strong and defiant. Gesturing forcefully at his son (who is slumped against a tree), Rip acts to regain his sense of belonging in a now-unfamiliar world.</p>

Van Gogh had seen works by Signac and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40810"">Georges Seurat</a> in the spring of 1886 at the final Impressionist exhibition. Signac was an eloquent spokesman for Seurat’s pioneering Neo-Impressionism, explaining it as a natural development of Impressionism. Under Signac’s influence, Van Gogh’s palette brightened, his brushstrokes became more varied, and his subject matter expanded. The setting of this work is the Seine River at the Pont de Clichy, near Asnières, where Van Gogh and Signac painted together on several occasions.</p>

Pieter Claesz. was a leading painter of a type of still life often described as a “banquet piece,” which featured luxury foods and serving vessels, typically strewn across an elaborately dressed tabletop. These costly goods—like the lemon, olives, sweetmeats, and lace-edged damask tablecloth in this painting—were sometimes depicted in a state of decay to suggest the transitory nature of coveted earthly things. The well-preserved items here instead celebrate wealth and its lavish display.</p>

John’s unlikely birth to the elderly Elizabeth prefigured the miraculous birth of Jesus, and John later preached to his divine cousin’s followers and baptized them into the faith. Here, the artist placed the biblical figures in a contemporary setting with recognizable elements of a 16th-century Florentine interior, including the portable terracotta vessel holding heated coals, called a brazier, and a fireplace made of gray sandstone (<em>pietra serena</em>).</p>

However, this painting is a reﬂection of his association with the great Neoclassical sculptor <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/33858/antonio-canova"">Antonio Canova</a>—and of Canova’s exacting working process, which involved two-dimensional preparatory works as well as studies in terracotta and plaster. The plaster model was a key element in Canova’s design process, serving as the basis for adjustments before the ﬁnal execution in marble. In a few instances, as here, Canova also commissioned paintings based on the plaster model, both to show to the patron and to anticipate the effects of light on the three-dimensional work. The plaster model for this tomb design survives in the Gipsoteca Canoviana, Possagno, Italy, but a large marble was never made.

In <em>Apples and Grapes</em>, however, he employed the complexity of color, light, and texture found in his most Impressionist landscapes.

Henri Degas and His Niece Lucie Degas (The Artist's Uncle and Cousin),"Edgar Degas (French, 1834-1917)",1875/76,1875.0,1876.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40543,France,"<p>Edgar Degas was the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group. His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.</p>

Mary Adeline Williams was a personal friend of the artist; Eakins first met her when she was a childhood playmate of his sister. Later, as an unmarried woman, Williams, who was known as Addie, lived with Eakins and his wife, Susan. Although Eakins’s portrait presents Addie as straight-laced and severe, this is in marked contrast with the active woman Susan Eakins described in her diary as riding bicycles, going to art exhibitions, and socializing between sittings for the painting.</p>

Composition (No. 1) Gray-Red,"Piet Mondrian (Dutch, 1872-1944)",1935,1935.0,1935.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-17549,Netherlands,"<p>The roots of 20th-century abstract art can be traced to the late 19th century, when artists began to move away from the direct representation of objects toward the communication of emotional states or moods. In doing so, the formal properties of art—such visual elements as line, color, and composition—assumed a primary role in its production. After World War I, many artists, including Piet Mondrian, believed that abstract art could contribute to a more harmonious society by communicating in a universal, visual language. In the wake of the war's destruction, artists associated with De Stijl (meaning, &quot;the style&quot;) in the Netherlands recognized the need for a break with the past, as well as a new aesthetic language to correspond to their utopian vision of the world. In 1917 Mondrian joined the De Stijl movement and began to develop a purely visual language of verticals and horizontals, restricting his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black rectilinear lines that framed smaller blocks of primary colors.</p>

He established his own museum dedicated to the arts and natural sciences and helped found the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1805. <em>Mrs. John Nicholson (Hannah Duncan) and John Nicholson, Jr.</em> is a tender portrait of mother and child. The natural backdrop and sprig of flowers in the boy’s hand signal a domestic bond. Mrs. Nicholson’s uncorseted dress and freely coiffed hair (without a wig) likewise speak to the humanistic ideals of the Enlightenment.</p>

In 1865 the artist traveled to Trouville, a French resort town, where he painted with Gustave Courbet and experimented with a series of increasingly simplified seascapes. The high horizon line and broad expanses of muted color in this spare composition reveal Whistler’s interest in Japanese woodblock prints. The sweeping, horizontal brushstrokes and restrained palette, limited to pale greens and soft grays, reinforce the painting’s innovative, flattened perspective.</p>

The artist’s attention to such details enabled the identification of this sitter: a signet ring in a companion portrait of her husband in the Philadelphia Museum of Art reveals her to be the Saxon princess Magdalena. A watercolor showing Magdalena in the same richly patterned dress suggests that Cranach made this portrait during his visit to Berlin around 1529.</p>

They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel).

Portrait of Emmanuel Rio,"Albert Schindler (Austrian, 1805-1861)",1836,1836.0,1836.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-102578,Austria,"<p>Previously known only as “a gardener and horn player,” recent research has identified the figure in this painting as Emmanuel Rio, an enslaved Brazilian man of African descent who was sent to Emperor Francis I in Vienna around 1820. About ten years old when he arrived in Vienna, Rio was enrolled in an elite private school, where he excelled in French, Italian, drawing, and especially music. Francis fostered his talent, gifting Rio a French horn on the occasion of his graduation. Despite his aptitude for music, Rio was assigned to work in the imperial garden.</p>
<p>In this portrait, produced a year after the emperor’s death, Rio holds his favored instrument while looking at an image of Francis, beneath which hangs a gold watch given to him by the monarch. The painting’s sentimentality does little to suggest the precariousness of its subject’s situation in Vienna, which only worsened after Francis died. For the rest of his life, Viennese officials moved Rio to various positions throughout Europe, threatened him with forced military service when he resisted, and, by the late 1840s, discussed sending him back to Brazil or to Africa.</p>

The Races at Longchamp,"Édouard Manet (French, 1832-1883)",1866,1866.0,1866.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35577,France,"<p>With a characteristic focus on the pleasures of modern life, Édouard Manet depicted this scene of the racetrack in the Bois de Boulogne, on the western outskirts of Paris. The popularity of Longchamp, where races were run for the first time in 1857, signaled a general revival in French horse racing. This painting records the last moments of a race, as the horses rush past the finish line, indicated by the pole with a circular top. Unlike traditional sporting artists, who always showed races from the side, Manet dared to compose the scene so that the throng of horses and jockeys thunders straight toward the viewer.</p>

Double-Sided Painted Banner (Paubha) with God Shiva,Nepal,16th-17th century,1501.0,1700.0,Pigment and gold on cotton,Painting,,Nepal,"<p>In this dynamic, double-sided painted banner from Nepal, designed to be carried high over the heads of the crowd during a religious festival, the Hindu God Shiva dances on his bull, Nandi, who turns his head upward to look lovingly at his Lord. This may represent Shiva as Nataraja, Lord of Dance, who is often depicted dancing atop his bull in Nepal. The other side depicts Durga, Shiva’s shakti (energy), dancing on a white snow lion.</p>
<p>The remarkably well-preserved painting is enlivened by the bold colors and vibrant textile patterns, the sashes flying out in all directions, and the swag at the top framed by flaring tassels. Large, striking flowers are scattered against the background. In his upper arms Shiva holds his traditional attributes the trident and the rosary <em>(rudrakshamala)</em>. He holds a Buddhist stupa (burial mound) in one lower hand—an unusual attribute—while his other forms the <em>vitarka mudra</em> (teaching gesture). That a Hindu deity should hold a Buddhist stupa illustrates the non-sectarian, all-encompassing nature of religious devotion in Nepal.</p>

The centennial fostered a sense of nostalgia among some residents as industrialization and urban growth rapidly transformed the nation. <em>Husking Bee, Island of Nantucket</em> depicts a seasonal gathering on the rural Massachusetts island. Community members work together to shuck corn and ready the harvest, a traditional activity that was far removed from daily life for many in the late 19th century. Johnson employed a warm palette and loose brushwork to describe this agrarian subject, presenting an uncomplicated vision of cooperation and closeness to the land.</p>

Eakins, an ardent advocate of studying from life, highlights this artistic working method in his rendering of the female form.

He created it during a trip to Europe in the early 1870s. It was previously thought to depict Étretat, in Normandy, France, but scholars now believe that the image is of Porto d’Anzio, Italy. The sky is illuminated by patches of orange and white light, outlining the ships and distant town on the horizon. Careful study of the surface of the central rock in the foreground illustrates the artist’s impressive manipulation of paint: by employing shifts in texture and shading, he was able to emphasize distinctions between sun and shadow, wet and dry, and clean and algae-covered. Inness traveled to Europe to study landscape painting with the masters of the Barbizon School, who were known for a personal style that contrasted with the grandiose Hudson River School in America. The influence of this intimate approach is apparent in the painting of the rocks and spraying seawater.</p>

Long inspired by the subject, Homer had spent summers visiting New England fishing villages during the 1870s, and in 1881–82 he made a trip to a fishing community in Cullercoats, England, that fundamentally changed his work and his life. The paintings he created after 1882 focus almost exclusively on humankind’s age-old contest with nature. Here Homer depicted the heroic efforts of fishermen at their daily work, hauling in an abundant catch of herring. In a small dory, two figures loom large against the mist on the horizon, through which the sails of the mother schooners are dimly visible. While one fisherman hauls in the netted and glistening herring, the other unloads the catch. Utilizing the teamwork so necessary for survival, both strive to steady the precarious boat as it rides the incoming swells. Homer’s isolation of these two figures underscores the monumentality of their task: the elemental struggle against a sea that both nurtures and deprives.</p>

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived.  The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.</p>

A Mexican Vaquero,"Frederic Remington (American, 1861–1909)",1890,1890.0,1890.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-21570,New York,"<p>A trip to Mexico in 1889 provided Frederic Remington with a wealth of firsthand material for paintings and illustrations created later in his New York studio. Here Remington depicted a vaquero, a Mexican horseman similar to the cowboys of the American frontier. The figure sits astride his horse at an elevated position, his head and torso above the horizon, outlined by the pale blue sky behind him. Portraying the man with a direct gaze and his hand on the reins, Remington suggested that the vaquero was a fixture of the local terrain. The artist created a version of <em>A Mexican Vaquero</em> as a wood engraving, which appeared in <em>Harper’s Monthly</em> in 1891.</p>

The technique, called pointillism, was originated by Signac’s friend <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40810/georges-seurat"">Georges Seurat</a>. Signac would prove to be the most ardent proponent of this style, which he made his own through particular attention to geometric form.

The Tale of Genji,Artist Unknown (Japanese),early 17th century,1601.0,1625.0,"Pair of six-panel screens; ink, colors, and gold on paper",Painting,,Japan,"<p>&lt;BIG&gt;この一双の屏風は、『源氏物語』54帖より、好みで選ばれた場面が描かれており、その5つの場面は、それぞれ時間的に隔たっているにもかかわらず、まるで一連の景観に描かれている。右隻の右半分には、赤子の光源氏を、父の帝が初めてご覧になっている場面、左隻の左下半分には、女房たちがどの季節が最も美しいか論じ合っている場面、同隻の右上半分には、源氏が最愛の女性・紫の上と手あぶりを前に、親密なひとときを過ごしている場面が描かれている。</p>
<p>それぞれが、人物たちの幸福な瞬間が捉えられていることから、恐らく、この屏風は、女性の婚礼道具として描かれ、婚家へもたらされたのであろう。このような装飾的な屏風は、衣服、蒔絵の化粧道具や遊び道具などの女性の様々な豪華な手回り道具の重要な一品目であった。</p>
<p>この作品における人物・風景の表現は、狩野派の特徴にあたる。恐らく、狩野派の源氏の屏風絵の中で初期に位置するものであろう。&lt;/BIG&gt;</p>
<p>This pair of folding screens depicts a few favorite moments from the 11th-century <em>Tale of Genji</em>, written by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu. Though they take place at disparate times in the story, the five episodes selected from the novel’s fifty-four chapters are set in one continuous landscape. Among these scenes is one on the far right showing the baby Genji being presented to his father, the emperor, for the first time. Across the bottom of left screen, court ladies argue which season is the most beautiful. Above, in the upper right corner, Genji and his love, Lady Murasaki, share an intimate moment in front of a charcoal brazier.</p>
<p>Each scene was seemingly chosen for its felicitous overtones. The overall character of the pair suggest that they were painted to be part of a bride’s wedding trousseau, and would therefore accompany her to her new home. Lavishly decorated folding screens made up an important part of such collections, which included kimono, lacquer toiletry sets, games, and other luxury items.</p>
<p>The figural style and landscape are reminiscent of the Kano school of painters. <em>Tale of Genji</em> screens attributed to artists of this school are the earliest-known screens to depict the story.</p>

In the late 1840s and early 1850s he traveled frequently to the Catskills, where he produced this oil sketch. Here, the gnarled trunk and branches of the weather-beaten tree offered the artist interesting variations of color, tone, and line. Cropsey often included such old trees in his paintings in emulation of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/34007"">Thomas Cole</a>, whom he greatly admired.

The objects depicted in this canvas, such as the Chinese blue-and-white vase and Oushak Turkish lotto rug, were likely collected during his extensive travels and represent the tastes of a worldly, wealthy man. The painting recalls 17th-century Dutch compositions in its focus on surfaces, textures, and illusionism. Like moralistic Dutch still life paintings, it evokes the fleetingness of life (<em>vanitas</em>) by juxtaposing objects that quickly decay, such as fruit and flowers, with the enduring arts of literature and music. The crisscross pattern of the parquet floor and the draped rug create spatial depth, offering a portrait of the Gilded Age, a time when an expanding economy encouraged the rich to collect such treasures.</p>

The scene depicts the emperor at age thirteen, three days after his accession. Seated on a gold throne placed on a carpeted platform, Akbar watches as his late father’s favorite is arrested for his insolent behavior toward the young emperor. The setting—a tented encampment pitched in a garden—is significant, for Akbar spent much of his reign on the move. Through his active campaigning and strong administrative skills, he greatly expanded the Mughal Empire, consolidating and securing it for his successors. In addition, he was a great patron of the arts, initiating a new style of painting and establishing a vast atelier and library.</p>
<p>One of the new themes the emperor encouraged was the painting of historical manuscripts such as the <em>Akbarnama</em>. Commissioned in 1589, it was written by court historian and biographer Abu’l Fazl between 1590 and 1596. Simultaneously, a workshop of about fifty artists illustrated the text. Basawan, the designer of this painting, whose signature appears in the lower margin in red, was one of the studio’s leading painters. He was particularly skilled in portraiture and is known to have painted the faces of the young emperor and the two other figures in front of him: the regent Bairam Khan, who is standing, and the disgraced Shah Abu’l-Ma'ali, who crouches in a red robe. He also painted some of the nearby scenery, which attracted his interest; each painting was collaborative work and could take up to a month to complete.</p>

Theodosius, the last emperor to command the entire Roman Empire, eventually submitted to the archbishop’s moral authority.</p>
<p>The brushwork and arrangement of figures in this composition showcase Alessandro Magnasco’s fluid, energetic style. However, for the elaborate background edifice, an imaginary interpretation of the atrium of an early Christian church, he most likely employed an unidentified specialist in architectural painting.</p>

The church, the carefully tended fields, and the hayrick on the right are all finely delineated in a manner typical of Inness’s early style. Although the artist’s reverent handling of color and light in this image has often been linked to his interest in Swedenborgian spirituality, it also relates to his admiration for this particular expanse of the American landscape. During the mid-19th century, the Catskill Mountain range was America’s premiere tourist site. The region’s close proximity to urban centers and abundant spectacular views made the Catskills a popular destination for those who wanted to escape from the bustle of modern life.</p>

Sébastien Bourdon’s figures wear draperies in the antique fashion, and the setting evokes both ancient Rome and the Christian Holy Land.</p>
<p>One of the most versatile and successful 17th-century French painters, Bourdon emulated the rigorous classical style of Nicolas Poussin. Bourdon knew Poussin’s work (such as the painting on view in this gallery) from his early years in Rome. Following Poussin’s compositional principles, Bourdon organized this scene as a series of parallel, stage-like registers, resulting in a calm, geometric order.</p>

Whistler executed several studies, including this one, which strongly resembles the finished painting. Carlyle endured numerous sittings, as Whistler labored over the portrait with particular emphasis on the aesthetics of the sitter’s black coat. Concerned with harmonious arrangements of color and form, the artist was less interested in depicting the details of Carlyle’s face. The composition is strikingly similar to Whistler’s <em>Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Artist’s Mother</em> (1871; Musée d’Orsay), also known as <em>Whistler’s Mother</em>.</p>

Particularly popular was his image of a Shrovetide entertainer who stirs a rommel-pot to delight a crowd of children with its screeching noise.  The composition was frequently copied—this version was once given to Hals himself and later assigned to Judith Leyster, who probably worked in Hals’s Haarlem workshop about 1630.  However, the painting does not show Judith Leyster’s distinctive style and should instead be considered to be the work of an unknown close follower of Hals paraphrasing his virtuoso brushwork.</p>

In <em>Kauterskill Clove, Catskill Mountains</em>, Gifford bathes the forested gorge in golden light. The scene’s thick, rich atmosphere transforms a topographical view into a romantic vista. A miniscule daub of blue paint on the rocks in the foreground suggests the presence of a figure and, in turn, signals the immensity of nature, visualized here as a place of spiritual transcendence. Gifford painted numerous versions of Kauterskill Clove throughout his career, with this small sketch completed during the last year of his life.</p>

They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

Buoneri may have assisted and modeled for Caravaggio during the elder painter’s last years in Rome, a personal connection suggested by his contemporary nickname, Cecco (a diminutive of <em>Francesco</em>) del Carravaggio. <em>The Resurrection</em> exaggerates the bold contrast of light and dark and the realistic treatment of sacred figures that were hallmarks of Caravaggio’s revolutionary style.</p>
<p>The only documented painting by Buoneri, this work was commissioned in 1619 by the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, Piero Guicciardini, for his family’s chapel in Florence. For reasons lost to history, the painting was rejected, a not uncommon event in Rome’s rapidly evolving art scene. It was eventually sold to another important collector, Cardinal Scipione Borghese.</p>

In this <em>thangka</em>, a painted cloth that can be rolled up for portability, Milarepa sits in a cave on Mount Kailash, which is sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus. In front of him, Lake Manasarovar (Marpam) flows by in wavy blue and green bands. Milarepa is flanked by his disciples, and his teacher, Marpa, appears in a medal-lion above him. The dazzling snow-covered peaks frame each of the central figures, and below them multicolored foothills appear as prismatic spikes refracting the sun’s rays like jewels. Along the perimeter of the <em>thangka</em>, the five sisters of long life ride their mounts, accompanying Milarepa wherever he preaches his doctrine. The sacred peaks and lakes of the Himalayas have inspired numerous works of art—Milarepa, for example, wrote one hundred thousand songs about them.

On each occasion he chose a similar vantage looking down on the small structure, which appears to grow out of the cliffside. The dimensions of this version are nearly identical to those of the other three canvases from the second visit. Here, Monet increased the amount of white in his paints to capture more nuanced atmospheric effects. He also experimented with techniques to animate the surface, at times scraping down or wiping away the still-soft paint to expose underlying colors. In the water, for example, breaks in the pale-gray paint reveal a bright green beneath, which the artist accentuated with additional touches of a similar green on top.</p>

Pieter Boel, who specialized in the game still lifes popularized in the Southern Netherlands by Frans Snyders (an example of which is on view in this gallery), executed highly naturalistic representations of fowl and canines during his years in Antwerp. The heightened shadows in this work reflect Boel’s study of Italian painting during a stay there in the 1640s.</p>

Using layered, broken brushwork, Robinson foregrounded the slope of the hill, leading the eye from the figure at right across the Valley of Arconville and beyond. Capturing the effects of light on the landscape like Monet and other progressive French painters, Robinson nonetheless rendered his forms with a measure of solidity that was more typical of American artists who worked in an Impressionist style.</p>

In <em>The Essex Canal</em>, a waterway faintly meanders from the green-hued foreground to a skim of blue along the horizon, with an expansive sky beyond. A younger generation of American artists celebrated Ryder as an important early modernist, who pushed toward abstraction and focused on the arduous process of painting itself as instrumental to one’s creative vision. Ryder’s reclusiveness only added to his intrigue and mythic status as an artist ahead of his time.</p>

Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist’s youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel’s pyramidal grouping of figures reﬂects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin’s enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist’s awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture. The expressive, idyllic quality of this painting presages the radiant ceiling frescoes of Correggio’s maturity, especially those in Parma’s Cathedral.</p>

By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, the artist helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.</p>

The Guardhouse,"David Teniers, the Younger (Flemish, 1610-1690)",1640/50,1640.0,1650.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-41190,Flanders,"<p>The versatile Flemish painter David Teniers turned to military paraphernalia as the subject of his still lifes in the mid-1640s, as the long conflict of the Thirty Years’ War was drawing to a close. Here soldiers play cards in the dim interior of a guardhouse, while a page carries the officers’ cloaks. However, the chief subject of the work is the pile of discarded armor, weaponry, and parade gear—a saddle, musket, powder horn, charging spanner, and gauntlets—in the immediate foreground. In treating armor as a still-life subject, Teniers followed the precedent of Jan Breughel the Elder, whose daughter he had married.</p>

The bearded Peter looks downward with a somber gaze, but John appears transfixed, his face bathed in a golden light that signifies the presence of Christ’s spirit.</p>
<p>The son of a prominent minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Tanner was perhaps the most renowned American painter of religious works at the turn of the 20th century.

The artist probably painted these oil sketches while living in Italy between 1770 and 1778. Both images were engraved as illustrations for Johann Caspar Lavater’s influential book on physiognomy, a popular pseudoscience that assessed an individual’s character based on their outward appearance. According to that text, the heads were inspired by the damned souls in Italian poet Dante Alighieri’s epic <em>Inferno</em>.</p>

The friar outsmarted the bandit, however, seizing his gun, shooting him in the thigh as he tried to flee, and finally tying him up. This story was extremely popular in the early 19th century and Spanish artists memorialized it in images, poems, and songs.</p>

In the poem, Elaine dies of a broken heart after being spurned by Sir Lancelot; Rosenthal’s painting depicts Elaine’s postmortem voyage from Astolat to Camelot: “In her right hand the lily, in her left / The letter—all her bright hair streaming down.” Rosenthal’s artistic choices reflect the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, a group of English artists who favored highly naturalistic details, richly colored surfaces, and subjects drawn from medieval literary sources. After it was purchased by an American patron, Rosenthal’s work sparked Elaine hysteria: clubs were formed in her honor, dirges and waltzes were composed, and copies of <em>Idylls of the King</em> sold out in bookstores.</p>

Blaue Reiter also promoted a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting, looking to non-Western, European medieval, and folk art for inspiration.

An Alcove in the Art Students' League,"Charles Courtney Curran (American, 1861–1942)",1888,1888.0,1888.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-5703,New York City,"<p>Charles Courtney Curran documented the atmosphere and activity of the Art Students’ League in New York, where he studied and later taught. Here male and female students practice rendering the idealized human form. Students worked from casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, as well as from reproductions of classically inspired Renaissance objects, such as Michelangelo’s allegorical sculpture <em>Night</em> from the tomb of Giuliano de’Medici, which occupies the lower left corner of this painting. In the 19th century <em>Night</em> would not only have served as an effective demonstration of the art of antiquity but would also have represented one of the more difficult poses to illustrate. Once students mastered drawing antique and antique-inspired sculptures, they would have advanced to a class with live models.</p>

It also combines standard motifs of the landscape and flower-and-bird genres.  Scattered across the foreground are mandarin ducks, lotus, and bamboo, a traditional grouping drawn from flower-and-bird painting of the Song dynasty.  But the trees growing from the right side of the same area are treated in a contemporary, early fourteenth century manner.  These trees lead the eye upward into the middle distance, where geese taking flight over rushes signify autumn, a seasonal reference confirmed by the bare treetops.  The touches of color used to highlight various forms in the foreground, and the blue-green coloring applied to some of the rocks, are both archaizing features that emulate painting of the Tang dynasty (618-907).  In the background are monumental mountain forms, convincingly portrayed as if shrouded in mist, derived from the Song landscape tradition.</p>

Although his large output included landscapes, genre paintings, and the occasional still life, he focused on biblical and historical paintings and on portraits. As an extension of these interests, the artist studied the effect of a single figure, made dramatic through the use of costume and rich, subtle lighting. Rembrandt collected costumes to transform his models into characters. Here, the gold chain and steel gorget suggest an honored military career, while the plumed beret evokes an earlier time. The broad black mass of the old man’s torso against a neutral background is a powerful foil for these trappings. The face is that of a real person, weathered and watchful, glowing with pride and humanity. The unidentified sitter, once thought to be the artist’s father, was a favorite model, appearing in many of the artist’s early works. The confident execution suggests that the young Rembrandt completed this picture about 1631, when he had left his native Leiden to pursue a career in the metropolis of Amsterdam; perhaps he wished to use this work to demonstrate his skill in a genre that combined history painting and portraiture.</p>

The subject raises his head and eyes toward the heavens in an echo of the conventional poses for Christian saints and martyrs. John Philip Simpson thus used familiar iconography to appeal to the sentimentality and supposed moral superiority of wealthy white viewers with the requisite power to sway public policy. But the deeply moving pose also reflects the artistic contribution of the man who modeled for the figure, now identified as Ira Aldridge, a free-born American actor famous for playing the title role in Shakespeare’s <em>Othello</em>. His performance in Thomas Morton’s musical drama <em>The Slave</em> may have been the immediate inspiration for Simpson’s painting. Aldridge was also renowned for his persuasive speeches for the abolitionist cause.</p>

Paris Street; Rainy Day,"Gustave Caillebotte  ((French, 1848-1894))",1877,1877.0,1877.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-3829,Paris,"<p>This complex intersection, just minutes away from the Saint-Lazare train station, represents in microcosm the changing urban milieu of late nineteenth-century Paris. Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. As part of a new city plan designed by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, these streets were relaid and their buildings razed during the artist’s lifetime. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist’s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions. The painting’s highly crafted surface, rigorous perspective, and grand scale pleased Parisian audiences accustomed to the academic aesthetic of the official Salon. On the other hand, its asymmetrical composition, unusually cropped forms, rain-washed mood, and candidly contemporary subject stimulated a more radical sensibility. For these reasons, the painting dominated the celebrated Impressionist exhibition of 1877, largely organized by the artist himself. In many ways, Caillebotte’s frozen poetry of the Parisian bourgeoisie prefigures Georges Seurat’s luminous <em>Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>, painted less than a decade later.</p>
","Considered Caillebotte’s masterpiece, this view of a busy intersection captures both an everyday moment and all that was new in a rapidly changing Paris. The clothes are the latest fashion.

Judith,"Jan Sanders van Hemessen (Netherlandish, active c. 1519-1556)",about 1540,1495.0,1580.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-11328,Netherlands,"<p>Judith was considered one of the most heroic women of the Old Testament. According to the biblical story, when her city was besieged by the Assyrian army, the beautiful young widow gained access to the quarters of the general Holofernes. After winning his confidence and getting him drunk, she took his sword and cut off his head, thereby saving the Jewish people. Although Judith was often shown richly and exotically clothed, Jan Sanders van Hemessen chose to present her as a monumental nude, aggressively brandishing her sword even after severing Holofernes’s head.</p>
<p>Van Hemessen was one of the chief proponents of a style, popular in the Netherlands in the first half of the sixteenth century, that was deeply indebted to the monumental character of classical sculpture, as well as to the art of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Judith’s muscular body and her elaborate, twisting pose reflect these influences. Yet the use of the aggressive nude figure here also suggests a certain ambivalence on the part of the artist and his audience toward the seductive wiles Judith may have employed to disarm Holofernes. In this work, Van Hemessen combined an idealized form with precisely rendered textures, as in the hair and beard of Holofernes and Judith’s gauzy headdress and brocaded bag.

","According to the biblical story, the widow Judith saved her people from slaughter by the Assyrian army by infiltrating the tent of the enemy general, Holofernes, to seduce and then behead him.

In contrast, Cornelius holds a volume of <em>Parr's Medical Dictionary</em> on his lap, and his saddled horse appears in the distant background, ready to go at a moment's notice.

The gilded backgrounds and festive architecture of the wings enhanced the splendor of the open altarpiece. The backs of the moveable wings, decorated with more somber Passion subjects in naturalistic landscape settings, were visible when the altarpiece was closed. The ensemble was dismantled in the late 17th century, and the panels were dispersed in the early 19th century, after the wings had been sawn apart, separating the Passion scenes from those on the interior.</p>

The Coast of Labrador,"William Bradford (American, 1823-1892)",1866,1866.0,1866.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-33731,United States,"<p>William Bradford devoted the bulk of his career to painting Arctic scenes like <em>The Coast of Labrador</em>. Rendered in minute detail and suffused with light, the artist’s Arctic compositions share stylistic motifs with <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/35239"">John Frederick Kensett</a>’s Luminist views of the Rhode Island coast. Bradford first traveled to Labrador between 1854 and 1857; it was not until 1861, however, that the region became his main source of inspiration. He returned to Labrador repeatedly over the next eight years. Signed and dated 1866, this painting probably derives from a number of sketches he accumulated during an 1865 journey, and it attests to Bradford’s interest in the diverse light effects and rocky landscape of the Arctic.</p>

The artist frequently combined his two specialties, as in this work, in which a monkey, an animal celebrated in this period for its mischievous and lustful character, snatches a few grapes. The French Rococo taste for the sensual is manifest in the lush, overripe quality of the fruits and flowers, reminiscent of 17th-century Flemish works that Oudry is known to have studied. Paintings such as this typically adorned dining rooms as part of an overall decorative scheme.</p>

Maize and Cockscombs,Artist unknown (Japanese),mid 17th century,1625.0,1675.0,"Six-panel screen; ink, color, and gold on paper",Painting,ARTIC-24535,Japan,"<p>During the Edo period, the prosperity and political unification of Japan under the ruling Tokugawa shoguns led to the emergence of a magnificent Japanese decorative style characterized by a love of bold patterns and bright colors. This new style was supported by the military class, a disenfranchised aristocracy, and a thriving class of merchants and entrepreneurs. The surviving half of an original pair, this splendid screen elegantly embodies both the techniques of ancient court painters and the curiosity and confidence so prevalent in the Edo period. Bursting with sensual fullness, the maize and cockscombs are rendered with the accuracy of a botanical drawing, a testimony to the era’s interest in natural science. The appearance of maize, a grain not native to Japan, indicates a willingness to assimilate new subject matter on the part of Edo artists and patrons.</p>

Cornelius Allerton,"Ammi Phillips (American, 1788-1865)",1821–22,1821.0,1822.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-20464,New York,"<p>As the wealth and population of western New England increased, individuals wished to record their success by preserving their own or their family members' likenesses for posterity. With this increased demand, talented sign painters such as Ammi Phillips saw new opportunities. Phillips taught himself to be a limner—a painter of portraits. By 1811 he had learned painting techniques from other Connecticut limners, who executed full-length, three-quarter, and bust portraits on canvas, wood, and glass. Phillips began to use conventional poses adopted from European prints and became one of the most successful portraitists of the middle and upper classes in rural New England, plying his trade in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.</p>
<p>Here Phillips depicted Dr. Cornelius Allerton seated in a painted chair against a somber, gray background. Although the sitter's face is relatively unmodeled, the artist's careful rendering of detail captures a sense of his individuality. The inclusion of a volume of <em>Parr's Medical Dictionary</em> conveys Allerton's profession, while a tiny horse in the distance may suggest his financial status. Itinerant painters such as Phillips were often commissioned to portray several members of a family; in this case, Phillips also completed portraits of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/55710/mrs-reuben-allerton-lois-atherton"">Allerton's mother</a> (1946.395) and mother-in-law (Connecticut Historical Society, Hartford). This painting was given to the Art Institute by Robert Allerton, the sitter's great-nephew and an important benefactor of the museum.</p>

Bamboo,"Kishi Ganku  (Japanese, 1749-1838)",early 19th century,1801.0,1899.0,Pair of six-panel screens; ink and gold leaf on paper,Painting,ARTIC-9264,Japan,"<p>&lt;BIG&gt;岸駒は、この大胆な竹の作品において、金箔地に墨で描写しただけでほとんど材料を用いず、竹の本質をとらえている。屏風の右隻では、川岸から立ち上がる竹の茎が強調され、一方左隻では、葉が作品の上端を越えて上方へ広がっているかと思わせる。</p>
<p>岸駒は､筆に墨をふくませ、同じ幅を保って画面上を走らせることで、竹の節間を描写している。墨をはじく金箔上のかすれと墨に､膠を加えることで、竹の表面の組織と光の影を自然に映す効果をだしている。</p>
<p>竹の情景の一部を厳格に切り取ることで、間近に立つか座って鑑賞すれば、竹林の中にいるかのように感じさせる。この作品は、それを完全に意識して作成されている。当初、五対一揃いの屏風であったことから、文人たちのサロン的な集まりの際、部屋の周りを囲むように立てることで、伝説の竹林の七賢になぞらえたのではないかと思われる。&lt;/BIG&gt;</p>
<p>In this bold study of bamboo rendered in monochrome ink against a solid ground of gold leaf, Kishi Ganku has captured the essence of the stalks with as few materials as possible. The screen on the right features the stalks of bamboo rising from the ground by a stream, while on the left we imagine the lofty upper reaches of the leaves beyond the top edge of the work.<br>Ganku rendered the sectional trunks of bamboo by loading the brush with ink and moving it evenly across the surface of the painting. In areas where the ink skipped across the non-absorbent gold or was mixed with animal glue, the results are naturalistic effects mimicking the bamboo’s texture or the play of light on its surface.</p>
<p>The severe cropping of the plants enhances the effect that one has, when standing or sitting close to the screens, of being in the midst of a bamboo grove.  This was completely intentional. Evidence suggests that these screens were part of a set of five pairs originally meant to be set up around the perimeter of a room or rooms during a salonlike gathering of would-be literati who compared themselves to the legendary Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.</p>

The paintings originally formed the interior of the wings of a folding triptych with the <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> as its center.

Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra,"Gustave Moreau (French, 1826-1898)",1875/76,1875.0,1876.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35824,France,"<p>Gustave Moreau developed a highly personal vision that combined history, myth, mysticism, and a fascination with the exotic and bizarre. Rooted in the Romantic tradition, Moreau focused on the expression of timeless enigmas of human existence rather than on recording or capturing the realities of the material world.</p>
<p>Long fascinated with the myth of Hercules, Moreau gave his fertile imagination free rein in <em>Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra</em>. Looming above an almost primordial ooze of brown paint is the seven-headed Hydra, a serpentine monster whose dead and dying victims lie strewn about a swampy ground. Calm and youthful, Hercules stands amid the carnage, weapon in hand, ready to sever the Hydra’s seventh, “immortal” head, which he will later bury.</p>
<p>Despite the violence of the subject, the painting seems eerily still, almost frozen. Reinforcing this mysterious quality is Moreau’s ability to combine suggestive, painterly passages with obsessive detail. The precision of his draftsmanship and the otherworldliness of his palette are the result of his painstaking methods; he executed numerous preliminary studies for every detail in the composition. In contrast to such exactitude, the artist also made bold, colorful watercolors that eschew detail, as exercises to resolve issues of composition and lighting.</p>
<p>Moreau seems to have intended this mythological painting to express contemporary political concerns. He was profoundly affected by France’s humiliating military defeat by Prussia in 1870–71. Whether or not Hercules literally personifies France and the Hydra represents Prussia, this monumental work portrays a moral battle between the forces of good and evil, and of light and darkness, with intensity and power.</p>

Her jewelry—a gold chain around her narrow waist, a pearl necklace, and a band of pearls on her hood—harmonizes with the rich, yet restrained ornamentation of her dress and embroidered white chemise. Louise de Halluin was still an unmarried attendant of the queen when she sat for this portrait. Corneille de Lyon’s small, keenly observed portraits of courtiers have their own precious, jewel like quality and were well adapted to the itinerant lives of their owners, who accompanied the court as it moved from one palace to another.</p>

The child’s clothes are equally elegant: she sports a high-waisted, white-muslin gown and holds a brightly colored strawberry, a delicacy often featured in the artist’s portraits. Johnson was the first known Black painter to gain professional recognition in the United States. Listed in the 1816 Baltimore city directory as a “free householder of Colour,” he had been freed by his enslaver (and father) around 1782 after apprenticing as a blacksmith. Described as “self-taught” in a newspaper advertisement, Johnson attracted local patrons among the city’s artisan and middle-class families.</p>
","Joshua Johnson, one of the first prominent African American artists, was known for his portraits of white middle-class families. The son of a white man and an enslaved woman, Johnson was originally enslaved before becoming free when he came of age.

Although they were depicted in the center of a circus ring, the sisters actually posed in costume in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s studio, enabling him to paint them in daylight. Here he portrayed them just as they have finished their act and are taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that the audience has tossed in tribute. Although <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> reﬂects the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood—he has enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites—the partially visible, darkly clothed (mainly male) spectators allude to the less wholesome, nocturnal demimonde of the nineteenth-century circus in which these two young performers grew up. The famed Chicago collector Mrs. Potter Palmer purchased <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> in 1892 and was so enamored of the picture that she kept it with her at all times, even on her travels abroad.</p>

Although Gerard David and earlier Netherlandish painters often treated the Lamentation as a private devotional subject, this panel was part of a large altarpiece devoted to Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin. It was made in Gerard David’s Bruges workshop for export to Spain. <em>Lamentation over the Body of Christ</em> formed the center of a row of narrative scenes supporting the superstructure of the altarpiece following Spanish convention.   Parts of the altarpiece are now divided between museums in Washington, D.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and Edinburgh, Scotland. In the years around 1500, Gerard David was the leading painter working in Bruges, a Flemish city with a distinguished history as a center of trade and artistic production.</p>

Heda’s still life may look like a snapshot of an abandoned meal, but the scene is carefully arranged, revealing the artist’s ability to create complex but harmonious compositions. Heda used the pewter chargers as horizontal elements in the foreground and the glass vessels and salt-cellar as verticals in the background, with the overturned ewer positioned diagonally to connect the two planes. Faint creases in the tablecloth, plates hanging precariously off the table’s edge, and the window reflected on the pitcher’s surface demonstrate the artist’s observant eye as well as his virtuosity in handling paint. Executed in a limited palette of silvers, grays, and browns, this work is an example of the “tonal trend” in Dutch 17th-century painting.</p>

A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884,"Georges Seurat (French, 1859-1891)",1884/86,1884.0,1886.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40810,France,"<p>In his best-known and largest painting, Georges Seurat depicted people from different social classes strolling and relaxing in a park just west of Paris on La Grande Jatte, an island in the Seine River. Although he took his subject from modern life, Seurat sought to evoke the sense of timelessness associated with ancient art, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture. He once wrote, “I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.”</p>
<p>Seurat painted <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em> using pointillism, a highly systematic and scientific technique based on the hypothesis that closely positioned points of pure color mix together in the viewer’s eye. He began work on the canvas in 1884 (and included this date in the title) with a layer of small, horizontal brushstrokes in complementary colors. He next added a series of dots that coalesce into solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance. Sometime before 1889 Seurat added a border of blue, orange, and red dots that provide a visual transition between the painting’s interior and the specially designed white frame, <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/articles/969/la-grande-jatte-frame-by-frame"">which has been re-created at the Art Institute</a>.</p>
","For his largest and best-known painting, Georges Seurat depicted Parisians enjoying all sorts of leisurely activities—strolling, lounging, sailing, and fishing—in the park called La Grande Jatte on the River Seine.

The Millinery Shop,"Edgar Degas (French, 1834-1917)",c. 1879-86,1874.0,1886.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40543,France,"<p>Of at least fifteen pastels, drawings, and paintings that Edgar Degas created on this subject during the 1880s, <em>The Millinery Shop</em> is the largest and perhaps the most ambitious. As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.</p>

A 20th-century term, Luminism has consistently been linked to the 19th-century philosophical doctrine of transcendentalism. Stylistically, it is characterized by a horizontal format; tight, invisible brushwork; and pervasive light emanating from an unseen source. Together these qualities embody the intellectual spirit of the American writer and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), who found transcendental unity in the contemplation of nature’s stillness.</p>

He retired from government service to his lakeside retreat and pursued painting, calligraphy, and poetry.

This poem displays the artist’s distinctively fluid, cursive “draft script” (cao shu). Its first section reads as follows:</p>
<p>Most men of the world fish with crooked hooks: I alone trust in hooks, but never in fancy baits. After rain, I carry my long pole to the terrace edge and dangle if from among pines and clouds above the ripples of Qi. (translated by Irving Yucheng Lo)</p>
<p>Qi refers to a river in north-central China. This river is cited in several verses of the Shijing (Book of Odes) – a compilation of more than three hundred poems datable between about 1000 and 600 B.C that extol men of principle.

In <em>Distant Mountains</em>, he used multiple ground planes and suggestive voids to create a majestic vista of jagged peaks and a meandering, wide river. Through the crystalline precision of his brush strokes, the artist achieved an image of great clarity and refinement.</p>

Grey and Silver: Old Battersea Reach,"James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834–1903)",1863,1863.0,1863.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-37279,London,"<p>James McNeill Whistler painted marine subjects throughout his career. For several years beginning in 1855, the expatriate American artist divided his time between London and Paris; in the latter, he was exposed to the bold realism and thickly impastoed surfaces of the paintings of Gustave Courbet. The older artist’s influence shaped Whistler’s depiction of the Thames River, a subject that frequently appeared in his work after he moved to London in 1863. In this painting, he focused on the river’s industrial nature—boats and barges, laboring men, and smoking chimneys—which featured so largely in urban life.  Yet despite the realism of the subject, Whistler unified the composition with deft brushwork and a subtle palette of brown and gray that anticipates his later interest in delicate tonal harmonies.</p>

Cliff Walk at Pourville,"Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1882,1882.0,1882.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>In February 1882, Claude Monet went to Normandy to paint, one of many such expeditions that he made in the 1880s. This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hoschedé (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband's death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet's sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition—divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time—and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel.Disappointed in the area around the harbor city of Dieppe, which he found too urban, Monet settled in Pourville and remained in this fishing village until mid-April. He became increasingly enamored of his surroundings, writing to Hoschedé and her children: &quot;How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!&quot; He was able to do so in June, when they joined him in Pourville.The two young women strolling in <em>Cliff Walk at Pourville</em> are probably Marthe and Blanche, the eldest Hoschedé daughters. In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass—composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes—appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women's wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-radiographs show that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky.</p>

Catholic reformers emphasized that religious painting should offer easily recognizable figures and narratives in order to be accessible to a contemporary audience. This canvas, made for the high altar of the church of San Román in Seville, Spain, depicts the church’s dedication to Saint Romanus of Antioch. Romanus towers over Saint Barulas, a child of seven, who was inspired to martyrdom by the elder saint’s words.

These works integrate characteristic features of the area—wide basins and river valleys flanked by the Umbrian-Marchigian Apennine mountain range—with pastoral details such as goatherds and dramatic atmospheric effects. Since the early 19th century, numerous American artists had traveled to Italy to further their artistic educations and to experience the history of European art.

During the summer months Gloucester was home to many artists, who, like Hassam, chose to emphasize its picturesque aspects, such as its quaint architecture and sailing vessels rather than its fish-processing plants. The composition exhibits Hassam’s broken brushwork and his use of bare canvas.

Executing this work in rural England (or possibly Nice in southern France), Sargent experimented with distinctly broken brushwork and a high-keyed palette. <em>Thistles</em> captures the tangled movement of the windblown plants in light and shadow. This landscape composition is remarkably abstract: the dynamic patterning of the thistles asserts the flatness of the picture plane more so than any sense of depth. Sargent continued painting en plein air throughout his life, a practice that provided needed respite from his busy schedule as an acclaimed portraitist.</p>

The suite illustrates Torquato Tasso’s popular sixteenth-century epic romance <em>Jerusalem Delivered</em>, which is set in the eleventh century, during the First Crusade, when Western knights sought to take Jerusalem from the Muslims. The canvas captures the moment of Rinaldo’s seduction: the beautiful sorceress Armida has just arrived to divert the sleeping hero from his crusade. Accompanied by her attendant nymph and a cupid figure, she appears like a beautiful mirage, enthroned on a billowing cloud, her drapery and shawl wafting gently behind her. Altough Tasso’s story symbolizes the conﬂict between love and duty, Tiepolo’s depiction of a magical, bucolic world—enhanced by effervescent colors, luminous atmosphere, and dense, creamy paint—seems to evoke only love’s enchantment.</p>

Adam,"Lucas Cranach the Elder (German, 1472-1553)",1533/37,1525.0,1542.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-34071,Germany,"<p>For most of his long career, Lucas Cranach the Elder was court painter to the Elector of Saxony. Although the general placement of Adam and Eve in <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=adam+and+eve&artist_ids=Lucas+Cranach%2C+the+Elder"">these paintings</a> reflects the influence of Albrecht Dürer's renowned classicizing treatment of the same subject in paintings and prints, Cranach's slender, undulating figures conform to the contemporary courtly ideals of beauty. This pair is one of the finest of the many versions of the subject made by Cranach and his workshop.</p>

"Conflagration of the Masonic Hall, Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Samuel Jones (American, 19th century (Possibly John Lewis Krimmel (American, born Germany, 1786-1821)",1819,1819.0,1819.0,Oil on mahogany panel,Painting,ARTIC-31651,Philadelphia,"<p>On March 9, 1819, Masonic Hall, built just 8 years earlier, burned to the ground. A Philadelphia publisher commissioned artists Samuel Jones and John Lewis Krimmel to create a composition of the fire’s devastation for distribution as a print (etched by John Hill). Circulation of such sensational events was an early 19th-century means of broadcasting news, expanding the reach of fine arts, and making a profit. Jones painted this work, which served as a study for the print. Krimmel, the nation’s first great genre painter, was hired to refine and amplify the figural scene in the foreground. As the print’s composition reveals significant changes to the figures, it is unknown if Krimmel executed any of the figures here, or if he developed his designs wholly apart from this painting.</p>

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>

Portrait of an Artist,French,c. 1735,1725.0,1740.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-46234,France,"<p>Professional women artists were rare in the 1730s. The Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which controlled artistic education and competitive art exhibitions called salons, was closed to women. Instead, artistic careers were traditionally limited to those born into families of artists, who could be trained by a male relative. The subject of this portrait probably belonged to such a clan. The presentation here emphasizes the sitter’s luxurious attire, including a swansdown scarf and a damask morning gown, as well as her vocation: she sits confidently before her easel, her palette in hand.</p>

Domenico Fetti also included an armillary sphere and telescope in the background on the left to reflect the scientific interests of the Mantuan court of his patron Ferdinando Gonzaga. These interests are further exemplified by the large, bluish sphere in the foreground illustrating the topography of the moon as had been observed only recently by Galileo. Yet the figure of Melancholia contemplates a skull: despite the achievements signified by the objects around her, their earthly value is fleeting, and death is unavoidable.</p>

After living in Venice and Rome, where he absorbed the late Mannerist style, the Greek-born artist settled in the Spanish city of Toledo in 1577 to work on the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The church of this ancient Cistercian convent was being rebuilt as the funerary chapel of a pious widow, Doña Maria de Silva. In El Greco’s grand design, the Assumption was surmounted by a representation of the Trinity and was ﬂanked by two side altars decorated with paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Resurrection. The visionary imagery of the Assumption and the Trinity aptly expressed the patron’s hope of salvation. Here the Virgin ﬂoats upward, supported on the crescent moon that is symbolic of her purity, while the boldly modeled heads of the crowd of apostles gathered around her empty tomb express amazement and concern. The vigor of El Greco’s broad brushstrokes proclaims the conﬁdent achievement of this early work, as does this artist’s large signature in Greek, painted as though affixed to the surface of the picture at the lower right.</p>

The Prairie on Fire,"Alvan Fisher (American, 1792-1863)",1827,1827.0,1827.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-53345,United States,"<p>Alvan Fisher was a pioneering American landscapist whose work offered an important precedent for the Hudson River School. This painting depicts a subject from James Fenimore Cooper’s 1827 novel <em>The Prairie</em>, the third of the five Leatherstocking Tales. In this scene, Natty Bumppo, the hero of the series, has created a firebreak to protect the story’s protagonists. As a Romantic-era artist, Fisher preferred such dramatic episodes, which involved striking contrasts between light and dark. Unlike contemporaneous illustrations of the scene, which give little sense of setting, in this version the figures are dwarfed by nature, and the prairie grasses are exquisitely rendered, underscoring the landscape’s beauty as well as its dangers. The work thus suggests the significance of the prairie in Cooper’s text. Perhaps for this reason, the author declared that it was “the only good illustration he had seen from his books.”</p>

Taken from Ovid’s epic poem <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Thoma showed the satyr Marsyas challenging Apollo, the master of the lyre, to a musical contest. Although he avoided depicting the cruel outcome of the match (the satyr lost and was flayed alive by Apollo), the artist’s treatment of Apollo, whose idealized body and luminous skin set him apart from the shadowy halftones of his challenger, hints at the winner. Thoma’s painted frame may also have been inspired by a tale from Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>.</p>

On the other side of the cross are Christ’s condemners and the cynics who rejected him, among them the soldiers who cast dice to divide up his clothing. Cranach was a good friend of the Protestant reformer Martin Luther, and though the Crucifixion was a subject more strongly associated with Catholics, Cranach included details that reinforce the Protestant emphasis on the power of faith and individual responsibility—for instance, the figure of the young boy learning from an older man at the foot of the central cross.</p>

Boats at Rest,"Arthur Wesley Dow (American, 1857-1922)",c. 1895,1895.0,1895.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-43629,Ipswich,"<p>In 1891 Arthur Wesley Dow began to engage seriously with the formal elements of Japanese art in his prints and oil paintings. In works such as <em>Boats at Rest</em>, he depicted locales around his native Ipswich, Massachusetts, using the radical cropping, elevated perspective, and flattened pictorial space characteristic of ukiyo-e (Japanese woodblock) prints. His palette of bold colors, however, is more akin to the work of French Post-Impressionist artists such as Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin. Dow’s Japanese-inspired theories of composition, which he outlined both in his publications and in the classes he taught at the Ipswich Summer School of Art and the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, were immensely influential to artists and designers working in both two and three dimensions.</p>

Peto’s still lifes, is replete with nostalgia. Strewn along a shallow shelf above a doorframe is an array of old, well-worn objects: candleholders with wax candles nearly used up, rusty oil lamps, and torn books. These discarded commonplace objects allude to older ways of life and fading memories. Peto specialized in trompe l’oeil (fools the eye) pictures; yet his soft-edged style is suggestive of the artist’s hand rather than the heightened illusionism employed by other trompe l’oeil painters such as <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/10930"">William Harnett</a>.

The Laundress,"Pierre-Auguste Renoir (French, 1841-1919)",1877/79,1877.0,1879.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36351,France,"<p>This canvas is Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s earliest painting of a laundress, a prevalent figure in the visual and literary culture of middle-class France in the 19th century. The model for the figure was Nini Lopez, a resident of Montmartre, the Parisian quarter to which Renoir moved in the summer of 1876. Lopez was characterized by writer and art critic Georges Rivière as the ideal model, for she was “punctual, serious, [and] discreet.” But while Lopez can be identified in <em>The Laundress</em>, this is not a portrait; her features are generalized and dissolve into a frenzy of brushstrokes. Instead, Renoir depicted a Parisian type—in this case, a young, working-class girl. When he painted this canvas, Renoir had recently finished four illustrations for Émile Zola’s <em>L’Assommoir</em> (<em>The Drunkard</em>), a gritty novel about the downfall of a laundress in the brutal and degrading world of working-class Paris. Renoir's vibrant portrayal of the laundress in this canvas is markedly different from the laundress's illustrated appearance, for which the Art Institute has a <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105461/workers-daughters-on-the-outer-boulevard-illustration-for-emile-zola-s-l-assommoir/"">preparatory drawing</a>.</p>

Woman Reading,"Édouard Manet (French, 1832-1883)",1880/81,1880.0,1881.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35577,France,"<p>During the late nineteenth century, Parisian cafés were the gathering places of artists and writers and were ideal locations for observing the urban scene. Many Impressionist paintings depict the Café Nouvelle-Athènes on the rue Pigalle, where two tables were reserved for Édouard Manet and his circle—a group that included the painters Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and the writers Charles Baudelaire and Émile Zola.</p>
<p>At first glance, this fashionably dressed young woman appears to have been captured sitting at a favorite café: the marble tabletop, beer mug, and magazine attached to a wooden bar suggest such a setting, and her heavy clothing and kid gloves indicate that she is at an outdoor table and that the weather is cool. However, the floral background is actually one of Manet's paintings and the café a re-creation in his studio.</p>
<p><em>Woman Reading</em> is one of the most Impressionist of Manet’s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career. Painted only a few years before his death, this work admirably captures a fleeting moment, the sense of modern life that Manet and his contemporaries sought to represent.</p>
","Édouard Manet was a pivotal figure in the development of Impressionism and modern art. Here, an elegantly dressed Parisian woman reads a magazine, a beer close at hand—a scene that would have struck contemporary viewers as fashionable and modern. While the woman appears to be outdoors, one of Manet’s paintings serves as a backdrop and other props suggest the scene was staged in Manet’s studio.",61.2 × 50.7 cm (24 1/16 × 19 7/8 in.),ARTIC-fd991fea-0c13-8444-7879-aba467f1d9db,https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/fd991fea-0c13-8444-7879-aba467f1d9db/full/max/0/default.jpg

Self-Portrait,"Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 1853-1890)",1887,1887.0,1887.0,"Oil on artist's board, mounted on cradled panel",Painting,ARTIC-40610,Paris,"<p>In 1886 Vincent van Gogh left his native Holland and settled in Paris, where his beloved brother Theo was a dealer in paintings. Van Gogh created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh’s style, reﬂects the artist’s response to Georges Seurat’s revolutionary pointillist technique in <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>. But what was for Seurat a method based on the cool objectivity of science became in Van Gogh’s hands an intense emotional language. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze. “I prefer painting people’s eyes to cathedrals,” Van Gogh once wrote to Theo. “However solemn and imposing the latter may be—a human soul, be it that of a poor streetwalker, is more interesting to me.” From Paris, Van Gogh traveled to the southern town of Arles for fifteen months. At the time of his death, in 1890, he had actively pursued his art for only five years.</p>
","Van Gogh’s face is as well known as his art—in fact, it is inseparable from it. The artist painted more than 35 self-portraits over his lifetime. This one was created in Paris under the influence of Seurat and pointillism.

This picture, undertaken around 1860, speaks to his ambition to realize canvases featuring scenes from the Bible, as well as ancient and more recent history. Degas took his subject from the life of Lycurgus, a legendary ninth-century b.c. Spartan lawgiver. Lycurgus’s social reforms included an unusual method of physical training in which adolescent girls competed on an equal footing with boys, exercising nude in public. Degas would have worked up this monochromatic sketch with layers of color had he completed it, but he left it unfinished when he began a second version of the subject (National Gallery of Art, London).</p>

Bareheaded and pensive, Rinaldo has taken up his shield again and appears to hesitate as the older knights gesture toward the boat that will carry them back to the crusader army and Armida implores him to stay.</p>

The artist painted at least six versions of the bridge over the course of six years; however, its shape is slightly different in each work. Twachtman may have altered the actual bridge or simply changed its appearance in each painting. Loosely rendered with feathery brushstrokes of green and rich brown, and incorporating expanses of unprimed canvas, this scene captures the rapid growth and verdant blossoming of spring.</p>

He was particularly inspired by the flat topography of his native Holland, a subject he returned to even after he had begun working in an abstract style after attending an exhibition of the Cubist paintings of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/33739"">Georges Braque</a> and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/36198"">Pablo Picasso</a> in 1911. Mondrian first sketched this farm around 1905. Nine of the twenty known related paintings and drawings of the farm, however, were created later, during World War I. Mondrian likely returned to the subject because his wartime patrons generally preferred his earlier naturalistic compositions to his recent experiments with Cubism.</p>

In style, technique, and the use of both Latin and Greek inscriptions, it shows a mixture of Eastern and Western elements. The diptych may have been made by an Italian craftsman, possibly working in the coastal city of Acre, which was the capital of a reduced crusader kingdom in the late 13th century. This type of private devotional work, and related Byzantine models imported back into Western Europe, exerted a powerful influence on later painting in Italy, France, and the Low Countries.</p>

The Garden of Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo,"Francesco Guardi (Italian, 1712-1793)",late 1770s,1775.0,1785.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-34761,Italy,"<p>A member of a family of painters in Venice, Francesco Guardi is renowned for his lively views of the most recognizable monuments of this picturesque city and for his engaging architectural fantasies, or capricci. Wealthy travelers making the grand tour of Europe—considered an essential part of an education for upper-class men—provided an important market for such views. In this case, however, the patron was not a foreigner passing through Venice, but John Strange, who lived in the city on the lagoon as the British resident, or representative.</p>
<p>This view of the garden of a private house in Venice was highly unusual for Guardi. On the right is the rear facade of the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo; the front faces the Grand Canal. The artist’s main subject here is the palace’s formal garden, a luxury in Venice’s crowded urban environment. Elegant couples stroll through the garden’s geometric parterres. Guardi’s attention to the play of light further animates the scene—a shadow cast by an unseen building in the foreground divides the composition and contrasts with the bright light reflected off the facade of the residence and the distant, shimmering lagoon on the left.</p>
<p>These observations of light and place probably reflect the aesthetic interests of Strange, who commissioned the painting from Guardi as one of a set of four remarkably original views. Two of the four paintings show Strange’s own villa on the mainland. What connection Strange may have had to the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo is unclear.</p>

He began 15 paintings of Vétheuil from the balcony of this rented home, all of which feature the same restricted view of the riverbank and town—punctuated by the church—and document the changes in light throughout the day. The Art Institute holds two paintings from the series, <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14634/vetheuil"">one from midday</a> and another from sunset. Painted on nearly square canvases, Monet divided each composition in half, separating the town from its reflection. Rather than replicating the area’s topography or creating a convincing illusion of space, Monet emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions blur the distinctions between the scene’s various forms, dissolving the borders, for example, between the water and the land and the land and the sky. The shapes of the different buildings along the shoreline emerge through changes in the direction of brushstrokes and slight shifts in hue.</p>

The picture grew out of a series of atmospheric views of working-class women in darkened interiors that the artist produced on two trips to Venice between 1880 and 1882. It combines the Impressionists’ gestural brushwork with a heightened chiaroscuro (light and shade) drawn from Spanish Old Masters such as Diego Velázquez. These compositions helped to establish Sargent’s reputation in Paris as a daring and original painter.</p>

The glassware and wash basin on the sideboard allude to her purity, as does the bouquet of lilies at the bottom right, while the lion finial marks her seat as the throne of wisdom. The fusion of contemporary bourgeois interior with religious iconography underscores Jesus’s humanity as well as the continued relevance of the biblical narrative.</p>

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings.

On the left, a large fishing vessel engages in business with a huckster, or peddler, who stands in a small boat in the shadows to the right, gesturing with a raised arm. Both the subject and low horizon draw on the tradition of 17th-century Dutch marine painting, but the work also reflects Turner’s growing interest in dramatic effects of atmosphere and light.

The Girl by the Window,"Edvard Munch (Norwegian, 1863-1944)",1893,1893.0,1893.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-44014,Norway,"<p>Edvard Munch’s life and art — particularly his iconic work <em>The Scream</em> (1893; National Museum, Oslo) — have come to epitomize modern notions of anxiety. Yet the same year he painted his radical image, Munch was experimenting with other styles and themes. Frequent visits to Paris and Berlin between 1889 and 1893 brought the Norwegian artist into direct contact with the Impressionists and Symbolists. These travels encouraged him to adopt their bold brushwork, daring compositions, and imagery. But he nonetheless continued to incorporate the Romantic subjects of the northern European artists long familiar to him, such as a lone figure at an open window. This combination is powerfully manifested in <em>The Girl by the Window</em>, made soon after his return home to Norway.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, a young girl in her nightgown stands in a darkened room gazing out at the city. The steep angle of the floor and the deep shadows that obliterate everything in the room, save a suggestion of a piece of furniture at the lower right, create an unsettling and enigmatic scene. Loosely applied, somber brown tones mingle with violets and blues, evoking a feeling of melancholy and anticipation. The window functions as a symbolic barrier, separating the interior from the outside world. The sense of mystery is deepened and complicated by the fact that we cannot see the expression on the girl’s face, nor do we know what she covertly observes. She in turn appears unaware that, as she gazes from behind the curtain at something unknown outside, the artist and implied viewer are watching her.</p>

Despite having essentially no formal training in the medium, Eichholtz progressed quickly, becoming one of the leading portrait painters in Philadelphia and nearby areas.

He called works such as this one an “arrangement,” emphasizing formal elements rather than subject matter. The painting still serves as a portrait—it was commissioned by Chicago attorney Arthur Jerome Eddy, a collector and advocate of modern art. After seeing Whistler’s work at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in the city, Eddy traveled to the artist’s studio in Paris expressly to sit for this portrait. The two became lasting friends, and Eddy published a book on Whistler after the artist’s death in 1903.</p>

But critics and the public did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects; they called him the “apostle of ugliness.”</p>
<p>The ample, demurely dressed subject of <em>Mère Grégoire</em> was inspired by the heroine of a popular song written in the 1820s by French lyricist Pierre-Jean Béranger. Béranger often penned ribald lyrics; his “Madame Grégoire” was the proprietor of a house of prostitution. Courbet depicted the woman here in the midst of a transaction, with coins scattered on a marble-topped counter and a ledger beneath her right hand. Under her other hand is the small bell she uses to summon one of her female employees. She presumably offers an unseen customer a flower, a symbol of love.</p>
<p>The painting may also have had a political subtext. Béranger and Courbet were fierce opponents of the monarchy and the Second Empire, respectively. In the mid-1850s, when Courbet began his portrait of Mère Grégoire, the government harshly attacked the songs of the popular writer as part of an effort to restrict free expression. Courbet’s decision to portray Béranger’s Madame Grégoire, whose flower exhibits the blue, white, and red of the French flag, may represent a protest not only against government censorship but also against the Second Empire itself, making the subject of this painting into a heroine embodying the rights to freedom in life and love that were forbidden under a repressive regime.</p>

Landscape of the Four Seasons,"Sesson Shukei (Japanese, 1504-about 1589)",c. 1560,1501.0,1600.0,Pair of six-fold screens; ink and light color on paper,Painting,ARTIC-23566,Japan,"<p>Sesson Shukei was a Zen Buddhist monk and painter who achieved his idiosyncratic painterly style during an itinerant career in eastern Japan, seemingly without ever traveling to Kyoto, Japan’s cultural and political capital at the time. Sesson’s dream-like Chinese landscape expands before our eyes in understandable spatial depth, an effect that is enhanced by the folds of the screen. Reading the composition in the same manner as the Japanese language, from right to left, the seasons flow from the first red plum blossoms of the year, depicted on the right side of the right screen (top), all the way across to the snow-covered mountains on the far left side of the left screen (bottom). A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.</p>
<p>For adherents of Zen Buddhism, a sect with origins in China, idealized landscapes described a world akin to paradise, in which intellectual and religious activities could be pursued unhindered and the cycle of the seasons symbolized the harmony and rebirth inherent in the natural world.</p>

A Dominican friar kneels before the enthroned Virgin, just below the figure of Saint Dominic, who intercedes on the friar’s behalf. Traces of hinges on the left edge suggest that the piece was part of diptych, probably paired with a painting of the Crucifixion.</p>

At the age of sixty-four, Heade settled in Saint Augustine, Florida. There he began painting detailed arrangements of native flowers, including the Cherokee rose, orange blossom, and magnolia. Stretched out like an odalisque on blue velvet cloth, the curvaceous magnolia was meticulously rendered in pale, subtle hues and illuminated by a light so sharp that the image evokes the hyperintensity of a dream. The warm, steamy atmosphere is almost palpable, as is the blossom’s heady, pungent scent.

Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.</p>
<p>Six pairs of sparrows are perched among the branches of a weathered plum tree that is partially obscured by a large, moss-covered boulder. Since the delicate, five-petal plum blossom appears at the earliest sign of spring, often when the ground is still covered with snow, it is interpreted both as a harbinger of spring and as a symbol for endurance and virtue in the face of adversity. Here, Ren Yi captured the frenetic energy of the sparrows, also a sign of spring, by depicting each one in a unique pose.</p>

Whereas Chai Jingyi specialized in semi-abstract images of nature that affirmed ideals of self-expression, Chai Zhengyi was most renowned for closely observant studies such as this. Depicted together with asters and Asiatic dayflowers, the fruiting wild rose (dog rose) places this scene in the autumn. Inhabiting this vegetation is a variety of graceful insects— the butterfly, mantis, locust, and other grasshoppers.

The two elegant saints are identifiable by their attributes: for Catherine, the wheel upon which she was tortured and the sword with which she was martyred; and for <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100347"">Barbara</a>, the tower where her father locked her up to keep her safe from suitors. Saint Catherine also holds a ring, which the Christ Child in the Brussels panel reaches to grasp, thus indicating that their mystical union was the subject of the triptych.  The tops of the two wings have been rounded off to mask their original function as moveable shutters to the left and right of the center panel.  The backs and fronts of the wings were also separated; the backs of the wings, showing the Annunciation when the triptych was closed, are now in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.</p>

Ad Astra,"Akseli Gallen-Kallela (Finnish, 1865-1931)",1894/96,1894.0,1896.0,Oil on canvas with a painted and gilded wooden shrine,Painting,ARTIC-9228,,"<p>After associating with the Symbolists, including <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/44014/edvard-munch"">Edvard Munch</a>, in Paris, Akseli Gallen-Kallela carried these influences to his native Finland while also incorporating indigenous folkloric traditions into his artistic practice. By intermingling Nordic Neo-Romanticism, Symbolism, and the decorative arts, he created a new visual language, which both spoke to and espoused the burgeoning sense of Finnish identity in the late 19th century. This conception of a unique ethnic culture reflected a general resistance within Finland to the dominance of Russia, which had conquered the country in 1809, as well as the rise of nationalist movements throughout Europe during this time.</p>
<p>The artist produced <em>Ad astra</em> (<em>To the Stars</em>) in rural Finland. He later built a wilderness studio and home there and this work decorated the space. GallenKallela saw the girl’s pose as recalling Christ’s Crucifixion. The suspension of gravity, as indicated by her hair, and the upward momentum evoke the triumph of the Resurrection. The frame, which he both designed and executed, was fashioned to resemble an altarpiece, and he employed the painting as one during his daughter’s baptism.</p>

Aristocrats felt as if they were living in an age of <em>mappo</em>, or Buddhist decline, and were preoccupied with the afterlife. This sutra is part of a famous set of 5,000 scriptures likely commissioned by Emperor Toba (1103–1156) and completed by his son, Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127–1192), in 1185. The frontispiece of the sutra shows the Buddha preaching at Vulture Peak. At the beginning of the text is the seal of Jingoji temple in red. The ruled lines of text are in silver, and the Chinese characters are brushed in gold in a balanced and orderly script. Those with the means to launch such a project believed that all involved received merit and were assured a favorable rebirth in paradise. As a result of this belief, decorated sutras were some of the most extravagant commissions of their time.</p>

Landscape with the Penitent Saint Jerome,Antwerp,1530–40,1530.0,1540.0,Oil on panel,Painting,,Belgium,"<p>In the midst of this expansive landscape, a tiny figure of the hermit Saint Jerome beats his breast with a rock in penance for his earlier worldly pursuits as he gazes at a sculpture of Jesus on the cross. In spite of this fervent activity in the foreground, the true subject of this painting is the vast landscape behind the saint. The artist rendered the mountains, valleys, rivers, and villages in successive bands of brown, green, and blue, the typical structure of the independent landscape that first emerged as a genre in this period. The roads that wind through the scene—metaphors for the journey of life—were a popular motif in Flemish painting and likely helped this work appeal to the growing number of art collectors in the booming city of Antwerp, a center of international trade.</p>

Abigail Inskeep Bradford belonged to a prestigious Philadelphia family; her father served as the city’s mayor (1800–01 and 1805–06) and her brother, John Inskeep, presided over a successful publishing business.

The Temptation of Saint Jerome,"Giorgio Vasari (Italian, 1511-1574)",1541/48,1541.0,1548.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-37130,Italy,"<p>Best known for his <em>Lives of the Artists</em>, a monumental compendium of biographies, Giorgio Vasari was a successful architect and a prolific painter for the Medici dukes of Florence. As a learned artist, he imparted an allegorical element to this frequently depicted episode from the life of Saint Jerome. The saint—a scholar, translator of the Bible, and advocate of monasticism—vividly described the tempting visions that assailed him when he retreated to the desert to meditate. In this painting, Jerome contemplates a crucifix; his visions are personified as Venus, the goddess of love, accompanied by cupids. Although Venus seems to flee, one of the troublesome cupids still aims his arrow at the saint. The work is unfinished: the black-chalk grid, used as aid in enlarging and transferring the preparatory drawing onto the panel, is still visible through the initial thinly applied paint layers.</p>

Singly or in pairs, the musicians play the large drum, clapper, oboe, vertical flute, transverse flute, hourglass drum, mouth organ, gong-chime, long zither, angular harp, and lute. Such instruments accurately represent those played by the mid- Tang dynasty (eighth century), as known today from surviving artifacts and textural descriptions of the Imperial Conservatory of Music. The audience for this concert strikingly resembles court figures depicted in <em>The Night Revels of Han Xizai</em>, a painting in the Palace Museum, Beijing, attributed to the tenth century painter Gu Hongzhong. Gu Hongzhong was a contemporary of Zhou Wenju, to whom this handscroll was originally ascribed. The artist responsible for this fifteenth-century painting apparently drew upon a number of earlier artistic models, creating a composite image that recalled the work of past centuries.</p>

Richly bejeweled and tattooed, with his horse's reins in one hand and a hookah mouthpiece in the other, Bhim Singh deftly projects an image of power combined with pleasure and comfort. The leashed cheetah and falcon seem to be merely part of the large entourage arrayed around the ruler, which also contains men bearing royal standards and insignia, including a black solar disk with a gold sun in the center, a symbol of the once-proud Sisodia clan of Mewar.</p>
<p>The magnificence of the scene belies the fact that Bhim Singh was actually a weak ruler in a succession of ineffectual leaders. Mewar had once been considered the strongest Rajput state because of its lengthy resistance to the Mughal emperors, but in 1818 Bhim Singh was forced to sign a treatey with the British, accepting their protection.</p>

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived.  The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.</p>
<p>A rich border region north of Paris, Picardy was a possession of the Burgundian Netherlands in the mid-15th century, becoming part of France in 1477. Its painters were strongly influenced by artists from the neighboring provinces of the Low Countries, among them Rogier van der Weyden and Simon Marmion.</p>

"The Bay of Marseille, Seen from L'Estaque","Paul Cezanne (French, 1839-1906)",c. 1885,1880.0,1890.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40482,France,"<p>In a letter to his friend and teacher <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/36211/camille-pissarro"">Camille Pissarro</a>, Paul Cézanne compared the view of the sea from L’Estaque to a playing card, with its simple shapes and colors. The landscape’s configuration and color fascinated him. This painting is one of more than a dozen such vistas created by the artist during the 1880s. Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional. Not locked tightly in place, his forms appear to touch and shift continually, creating a sense of volume and space that strengthens the composition and brings it to life.</p>

Like many of the artists in his circle, Toulouse-Lautrec experimented with styles and materials beyond easel painting. His decision to paint on a tambourine with little castanets (called a <em>tambour de basque</em>) was perhaps inspired by the instrument’s association with bohemian life and creative freedom. The shape of the tambourine mirrors that of the paper hoop held by the clown in the larger painting, so that our view here seems to be framed by the hoop just after the bareback rider has broken through it.</p>

Inspired by German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt’s concept of ecological interconnectedness, Frederic Edwin Church traveled to South America to meticulously study the tropical landscape. The artist produced at least ten finished paintings of the Ecuadorian volcano, this one completed in his studio just before his second visit to the region. For Church and other Christian viewers, nature, with all its creative and destructive wonders, was evidence of divine power. The painting likewise reflected an imperialist vision, as US government officials eyed Latin America as a site for territorial expansion and conquest.</p>

Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz,"Amedeo Modigliani (Italian, 1884-1920)",1916,1916.0,1916.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35801,Italy,"<p>After receiving his artistic training in Italy, the sculptor and painter Amedeo Modigliani moved to Paris in 1906. Three years later, he helped pioneer a general migration of artists to the neighborhood of Montparnasse, which remained the center of avant-gard activity in the city until World War II. Scores of artists lived there, and many of them shared a Jewish heritage—including Modigliani and his friend the Lithuanian-born sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.</p>
<p>Lipchitz commissioned Modigliani to paint this portrait on the occasion of his marriage to the Russian poet Berthe Kitrosser, as a way of helping his troubled friend financially. The double portrait is one of only three in the artist’s oeuvre and, according to Lipchitz, took two days to paint. Modigliani made about twenty drawings on the first day; the next day, he declared the picture finished. At the modest price of what Lipchitz remembered as “ten francs per sitting and a little alcohol,” however, he persuaded Modigliani to work on the portrait for another two weeks in an effort to provide more financial assistance to his friend. Despite Modigliani’s exceptional talent, his work found a market only after his death in 1920, which was hastened by tuberculosis and his legendary bohemian lifestyle.</p>
","Amedeo Modigliani created his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Focusing on a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms.

In this half-length portrait, the painter depicted Marion Deering seated with her right arm resting on a chairback, her eyes engaging the viewer. Sargent rendered her face and hand with a high degree of finish, skills he had fine-tuned in the 1870s while a student in Paris. The broader handling of paint in her dress and its lace embellishments signals Sargent’s facility with the tactile and expressive possibilities of paint. Indeed, in the mid-1880s, Sargent not only worked in portraiture, but also experimented with the themes and vocabularies of Impressionism.</p>

Landscape with Saint John on Patmos,"Nicolas Poussin (French, 1594-1665)",1640,1640.0,1640.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36259,France,"<p>Although French by birth and training, Nicolas Poussin spent most of his career in Rome, immersed in the study of ancient art, where he painted classically inspired works for an educated elite. His art has long been considered the embodiment of the ideals of seventeenth-century classicism. In this painting, Saint John, one of the four Evangelists who wrote the Gospels of the New Testament, reclines beside his attribute, the eagle. He is here depicted as a powerful old man, presumably after retiring to the Greek island of Patmos to write his gospel and the book of Revelation at the end of his life. To suggest the vanished glory of the ancient world, Poussin carefully constructed an idealized setting for the saint, complete with an obelisk, a temple, and column fragments. Man-made and natural forms were adjusted according to principles of geometry and logic to convey the measured order of the scene. Even the profile view of Saint John is in harmony with the classical landscape. This painting may have been part of a projected series on the four Evangelists—in addition to this work, Poussin completed a companion, <em>Landscape with Saint Matthew</em> (1640; Gemäldegalerie, Berlin).</p>

This panel represents Catherine Benincasa of Siena (1347–1380), who was one of the major religious figures and most influential women of the late Middle Ages. Affiliated with the Dominican order, she was renowned for her devotion to the poor and sick, as well as for her mystical visions. In one such vision, she saw herself marked with Christ’s wounds from his crucifixion, known as the stigmata. These marks are faintly visible on the backs of her hands in the present work and serve to identify her.</p>

Mississippi Fisherman,"George Caleb Bingham (American, 1811-1879)",c. 1850,1850.0,1850.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-50071,United States,"<p>George Caleb Bingham portrayed a man quietly fishing in a secluded spot, delineating the figure and environs with controlled brushwork. Raised in Missouri, Bingham specialized in genre paintings of white working-class boatmen who facilitated the brisk movement of commercial goods along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers in the mid-19th century. Here, the figure’s loose-fitting shirt, boots, and hat convey his role as a laborer in the area’s river economy.</p>
<p>Achieving a national reputation as an artist, Bingham also engaged in politics, holding positions in Missouri state government. During the 1850s he was a staunch advocate for the preservation of the Union and spoke out against slavery. Focusing on everyday activities that transpired along interregional waterways, Bingham reinforced the critical ties between west and east, north and south, amid a disquieted nation.</p>

A City Park,"William Merritt Chase (American, 1849-1916)",c. 1887,1887.0,1887.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-41673,New York City,"<p>William Merritt Chase was one of the most influential painters in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. After an extended stay in Europe, which ended when he established his studio in New York City in 1878, Chase demonstrated his extraordinary versatility, painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and genre scenes. His vigor as an artist was equaled by his long and successful career as a teacher: his classes at the Art Students League in New York and the Shinnecock Hills Summer School on Long Island attracted many students.</p>
<p>In the mid-1880s, Chase embarked on a group of plein-air paintings inspired by New York's parks. Influenced by the brilliant colors and unorthodox compositional formats of the French Impressionists, he often countered a broad, comparatively empty foreground with a detailed background. In this painting, which probably depicts Brooklyn’s Tompkins Park, almost half the canvas is filled by the wide, empty walkway, which, with its strong diagonal borders, carries the eye into the composition. This swift movement into space is slowed by the woman on the bench, who appears to gaze expectantly toward someone approaching along the path. To the left, colorful flowers provide a contrast to the bare walk at the right. This informal, seemingly spontaneous work, capturing the sparkle, light, and activity of a summer day, testifies to the freshness and vitality that Chase brought to the painting of such scenes.</p>

This late painting combines elements from both types, like smoking and drinking figures and musicians serenading a dancing couple.

In the mid-16th century, many members of Antwerp’s newly wealthy merchant class commissioned half-length, small-scale likenesses such as this one to commemorate their prosperity and standing.

This strong and lively work aptly captures that moment of transition, combining landscape and portraiture in a composition that speaks to friendship and painterly pursuits while also celebrating color, surface, and fleeting effects of light and movement. The couple is Wilfrid and Jane Emmet de Glehn, professional artists and Sargent’s frequent traveling companions. Although <em>The Fountain</em> has the appearance of spontaneity, Sargent was frequently interrupted by rain as he worked. He thus completed it over several days, requiring his friends to pose at length.</p>

Although <em>The Annunciation</em> appears to be an independent painting, it is actually a fragment that once formed the right side of an altarpiece; the left side, now in the National Gallery, London, depicts the moment of Mary’s own Immaculate Conception, believed to have occurred when her parents, Joachim and Anne, greeted each other at the Golden Gate. A central section, now lost, probably featured the enthroned Virgin and Child, perhaps with Saint Anne. Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins,was the leading painter working in France in the last decades of the fifteenth century. He worked in Moulins in central France for Duke Pierre II of Bourbon and his wife, Anne of France, who played a large role in the government of of the kingdom during the minority of Anne’s brother Charles VIII. As their court painter, Hey, who was probably of Netherlandish origin, fused the intense naturalism and preciousness of Flemish and French painting and manuscript illumination with the emerging Renais-sance interest in antiquity, as is evident in this painting’s Italianate architecture.</p>

In these delicate screens, premier court painter Tosa Mitsuoki meditated on the inevitable passage of beauty by depicting the melancholy hours after the departure of reveling courtiers. A cherry tree bursts into bloom on the right screen (seen here at top), while its mate displays the brilliant red and gold foliage of maples in autumn. Slips of poetry, called <em>tanzaku</em>, waft from the blossoming limbs, the lingering signs of a human presence. Courtiers (whose names are recorded in a seventeenth-century document) assisted Mitsuoki by inscribing the narrow strips with quotations of appropriate seasonal poetry from twelfth- and thirteenth-century anthologies. The screens were either commissioned by or given to Tofukumon’in (1607–1678), a daughter of the Tokugawa shogun who married the emperor Gomizunoo (1596–1680). In an era otherwise marked by increasing control of the feudal shogunate over imperial prerogatives, this royal couple encouraged a renaissance of courtly taste that nostalgically evoked the past glories of early medieval aristocratic life.</p>

He was strongly influenced by the precisely rendered Venetian scenes of Canaletto and Michele Marieschi. In this work, one of his most important early cityscapes, Guardi depicted the mouth of the Grand Canal hustling with late-afternoon activity. The church of Santa Maria della Salute and the customhouse are visible on the right. The emotional tenor of Guardi’s vedute—seen here in the brooding, melancholy aura of the sky—distinguishes them from the works of his predecessors.</p>

Paradise Flycatchers and Wisteria,"Ren Yi (Chinese, 1840-1895)","Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1892",1840.0,1895.0,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Painting,ARTIC-20727,China,"<p>Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School.  Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes,  and greater tonal variation.</p>
<p>The contrast between the delicate flowers and thick vines of the wisteria make this plant ideal for showcasing an artist’s calligraphic prowess. In this painting, Ren Yi demonstrates his impressive range of brush techniques: dry, rough strokes dragged across the paper compose the wisteria vines; wet jumbles of short strokes imbue volume to the rocks; and subtle gradations of color dotted on the paper form the wisteria flowers. In the center sits a pair of paradise flycatchers. Their Chinese name, <em>shoudai niao</em> (sash bird), which describes the species’ long ribbonlike tails, is a homophone for the term <em>shou</em> (longevity). By combining a vibrant palette of colors, some of which were imported from Europe, with the bravado of his monochromatic brush technique, Ren Yi imbued past traditions with fresh innovation.</p>

The Fountain at Grottaferrata, completed some years after the artist returned to Germany, is based on his detailed drawings of the countryside just outside Rome.

"Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day)","Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1890/91,1890.0,1891.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be""><em>Stacks of Wheat</em></a> rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>

Mr. Benjamin Schaum,"Jacob Eichholtz (American, 1776-1842)",1808–10,1808.0,1810.0,Oil on yellow poplar panel,Painting,ARTIC-43630,Lancaster,"<p>Working as a coppersmith in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Jacob Eichholtz aspired to be a portraitist, eventually giving up his metalwork business to focus on painting by 1811. Despite having essentially no formal training in the medium, Eichholtz progressed quickly, becoming one of the leading portrait painters in Philadelphia and nearby areas. These portraits of the family of Benjamin Schaum (<a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61151/mrs-benjamin-schaum-anna-maria-heckensweiler"">1980.743</a>, <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61156/master-schaum"">1980.744</a>, and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64686/miss-schaum"">1980.745</a>), a fellow resident and coppersmith in Lancaster, are examples of the artist’s early style. Eichholtz first mastered small, profile portraits like these, typically executed on wooden panels. Later he developed a more sophisticated handling of the figure, rendering larger-scale compositions on canvas of his sitters in three-quarter views.</p>

Venetian Glass Workers,"John Singer Sargent (American, 1856–1925)",1880–82,1880.0,1882.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36540,Venice,"<p>Trained in Paris, John Singer Sargent traveled to Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy early in his career in order to study how painters such as Diego Velázquez and Frans Hals captured the effects of light and rendered figures in space. <em>Venetian Glass Workers</em> is one of several genre scenes featuring glass-bead workers that Sargent executed in the early 1880s. This backlit view of a shop in Venice is dark and atmospheric except for the brilliant strokes of light green and silvery white paint that describe the canes of glass as tradespeople prepare to cut them into bead-sized pieces, which will then be polished and strung into jewelry.</p>

After Napoleon placed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the Spanish throne in 1808, the people rose up in rebellion, eventually driving the French out with the help of the British army. Although his own sentiments were patriotic and liberal, Francisco de Goya dutifully fulfilled his obligations as first painter to the king. This is a portrait of José Manuel Romero, a minister under Joseph Bonaparte, although the degree to which the man is overwhelmed by his splendid court uniform and decorations may suggest a certain lack of sympathy on the part of the artist.</p>

Emperor Heraclius Denied Entry into Jerusalem,Netherlandish,1460/80,1485.0,1495.0,Tempera and oil on panel,Painting,,Netherlands,"<p>This panel recounts the adventures of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who rescued the True Cross and returned it to Jerusalem after its capture by Chosroës, king of Persia. These scenes were probably part of an extended narrative on an altarpiece dedicated to the Holy Cross, a relic that was much venerated in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>In this scene, the emperor brings the True Cross back to Jerusalem in triumph. However, an angel bars his way, pointing out the vanity of his procession in comparison to Christ’s humble entry into the city. Only when the emperor dismounted and approached in humility was he allowed to enter, a scene that was no doubt once part of the sequence. Here the emperor is identifiable by the double-headed eagle, which was an emblem of both the Holy Roman emperor of the day and past emperors.</p>

Bourdon returned there briefly in the midst of a career that included early years in Rome, successful activity in Paris, and a short stint at the Stockholm court of Queen Christina of Sweden from 1652 to 1653. The large, isolated swath of fabric on the left and the absence of the sitter’s left hand suggest that it was cut from Bourdon’s group portrait.</p>

Yet Peale ignored its low status and is now acknowledged as America’s first professional still-life painter and leading practitioner of the genre. Born into an artistic Philadelphia family, Raphaelle was the eldest son of Charles Willson Peale and the nephew of James Peale, both artists; his siblings were, like him, named after famous old master painters (he had brothers named Rembrandt, Titian, and Rubens). Characterized by crisp forms and serenely balanced compositions, most of Peale’s still lifes portray food, crockery, and glassware arranged on a plain shelf, parallel to the picture plane. In this particularly fine example, the rhythmic balance of fruit, nuts, and Chinese export porcelain is enlivened by the diagonal branch of grapes becoming raisins and an orange leaf. These objects are brightly illuminated against a bare, dark background in the manner of the dramatic still-life compositions of 17th-century painters such as <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/84709"">Juan Sánchez Cotán</a>. Peale may have seen the Spanish artist's work when it was shown at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1818.</p>

Other disciples nonchalantly engage on superficially mundane activities that allude to Buddhist conduct, such as mending clothes and reading sutras. A lion, elephant, tiger, dragon, and phoenix are also in attendance; some serve as traditional vehicles of Buddhist deities, whereas others are more generally auspicious. Together, these personalities exude the vitality of a secularized but nonetheless sincere faith.</p>

Paired images of the mourning Virgin and Christ crowned with thorns, made in the workshop of Dieric Bouts, were an especially successful formulation, judging from the many extant versions. Set against a gold background signifying a timeless, heavenly realm, the Virgin was both an embodiment of compassion and an intercessor for humankind with Christ. No autograph example of this pair by Bouts survives; this exceptionally fine painting of the Virgin was probably made by his son, Dieric Bouts the Younger, who carried on the activity of the workshop after his father’s death.</p>

The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>

According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel).

The fluted, monumental column in the background underscores the period taste for elegance and classical traditions. The companion portrait depicts Joseph Klapp in contemplation, emphasizing his study of medicine. Together, the portraits present an image of a sophisticated couple that celebrates their prosperity, intelligence, and taste.</p>

A large dahabeah, or houseboat, balances on the low horizon line. The building in the right background might be the temple at Luxor or the one at Philae, the latter of which Eugène Fromentin mentioned in the diary he kept while traveling in Egypt during the fall of 1869.</p>
<p>Fromentin was in Egypt to witness the opening of the Suez Canal; he based this composition on sketches he made at the time. While Orientalism—European representations of Near Eastern and North African places and people—was beginning to wane by the time Fromentin painted this scene, the opening of the canal marked a new age of colonial imperialism.</p>

Point Breeze was the name of the country estate owned by Joseph Napoleon Bonaparte (the older brother of the French emperor Napoleon I), who fled to America after his brother’s fall from power. Under a warm, golden light, Napoleon’s homestead presides atop a hill, with a stone bridge, lake, curving paths, gently sloping hills, and bucolic vegetation creating a picturesque vista. The artist’s tight, detailed style, infused with green and autumnal hues, aptly captures the romantic feel of this cultivated landscape.</p>

The two form a pair that share a palette, subject, and vantage point. In one of his daily letters to his companion and future wife, Alice Hoschedé, dated November 24, 1885, Monet he described first <em>Boats on the Beach</em> and then <em>Departure of the Boats</em>: “In the afternoon, I worked in my room on my <em>caloges</em> [retired fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain, then I attempted to do, always through the window, a picture of the boats departing.”</p>
<p>Monet centered each composition on the boats, combining pastel blues, pinks, purples, and greens to render wet surfaces. The brightly colored hulls of beached crafts lend relative scale to the structures in <em>Boats on the Beach</em>, and the groups of figures at the water’s edge, composed of quick, gestural strokes, register human activity in <em>Departure of the Boats</em>.</p>

Lucretia was hailed as a hero for subsequently committing suicide in an attempt to avoid any perceived dishonor to her family. With his characteristic expressive distortions of anatomy and space and vibrant treatment of light, Tintoretto depicted one of the most violent moments of the story. As Tarquin and Lucretia struggle, a pillow flies through the air, her pearl necklace breaks apart, and the fabric and carved post of the bed’s canopy collapses around them.</p>

Vétheuil,"Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1901,1901.0,1901.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>In summer 1901 Claude Monet rented a modest house in Lavacourt, a small hamlet across the Seine from Vétheuil and not far from his property at Giverny, which he was in the process of expanding. He began 15 paintings of Vétheuil from the balcony of this rented home, all of which feature the same restricted view of the riverbank and town—punctuated by the church—and document the changes in light throughout the day. The Art Institute holds two paintings from the series, one from midday and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16579/vetheuil"">another from sunset</a>. Painted on nearly square canvases, Monet divided each composition in half, separating the town from its reflection. Rather than replicating the area’s topography or creating a convincing illusion of space, Monet emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions blur the distinctions between the scene’s various forms, dissolving the borders, for example, between the water and the land and the land and the sky. The shapes of the different buildings along the shoreline emerge through changes in the direction of brushstrokes and slight shifts in hue.</p>

Emperor Heraclius Slays the King of Persia,Netherlandish,1460/80,1485.0,1495.0,Tempera and oil on panel,Painting,,Netherlands,"<p>This panel was probably part of an altarpiece dedicated to the Holy Cross, a relic that was much venerated in the Middle Ages. Through repeated retelling, its story took on some of the qualities of a chivalric romance. That story included the adventures of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who rescued the True Cross and returned it to Jerusalem after its capture by Chosroës, king of Persia.</p>
<p>Here Heraclius defeats a king who is probably meant to be the son of Chosroës. The emperor can be identified by the closed imperial crown that caps his helmet, the double-headed eagle symbol on the trumpet and the trappings of his followers’ horses, and the fact that he is about to behead his opponent. This exciting narrative provides an excuse for a vivid display of armor and weaponry.</p>

The Bedroom,"Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 1853-1890)",1889,1889.0,1889.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40610,Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,"<p>Vincent van Gogh so highly esteemed his bedroom painting that he made three distinct versions: the first, now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; the second, belonging to the Art Institute of Chicago, painted a year later on the same scale and almost identical; and a third, smaller canvas in the collection of the Musée d’Orsay, Paris, which he made as a gift for his mother and sister. Van Gogh conceived the first <em>Bedroom</em> in October 1888, a month after he moved into his “Yellow House” in Arles, France. This moment marked the first time the artist had a home of his own, and he had immediately and enthusiastically set about decorating, painting a suite of canvases to fill the walls. Completely exhausted from the effort, he spent two-and-a-half days in bed and was then inspired to create a painting of his bedroom. As he wrote to his brother Theo, “It amused me enormously doing this bare interior. With a simplicity à la Seurat. In ﬂat tints, but coarsely brushed in full impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ﬂoor in a broken and faded red, the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet very pale lemon green, the bedspread blood-red, the dressing-table orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. I had wished to express utter repose with all these very different tones.” Although the picture symbolized relaxation and peace to the artist, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil, an effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.</p>
","In 1888, Van Gogh moved into his own homee in Arles, France. He dubbed it the “Studio of the South,” hoping that fellow artists would join him there to work. This is one of three versions he painted of his beloved Arles bedroom. While its vivid palette and dramatic perspective seem to burst with nervous vitality, Van Gogh intended the painting ""to express utter repose.""",73.6 × 92.3 cm (29 × 36 5/8 in.),ARTIC-25c31d8d-21a4-9ea1-1d73-6a2eca4dda7e,https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/25c31d8d-21a4-9ea1-1d73-6a2eca4dda7e/full/max/0/default.jpg

While most artists avoided this systematic and inflexible technique for portraits, Lemmen was one of the few who successfully applied it to a psychologically intense likeness. In this depiction of his sister, Julie Fréderique Lemmen, the artist captured what his daughter described as Julie’s “biting personality” while also signaling her vulnerability through her demure pose.</p>

Rocky Coast,"John Frederick Kensett (American, 1816-1872)",c. 1860,1860.0,1860.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35239,United States,"<p>Like the Impressionists, who emphasized light effects, painters of the Hudson River School focused on temporal conditions of the landscape to suggest specific atmospheres. In <em>Rocky Coast</em>, John Frederick Kensett depicted the shoreline on a hazy day, with calm water and gentle waves. The careful treatment of nature by the Hudson River School artists has been linked to the writings of Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote in <em>Nature</em> (1836): “Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball. I am nothing. I see all.” The horizon line of <em>Rocky Coast</em> illustrates this idea, as the uninterrupted water appears infinite, suggesting that the ocean continues beyond the vision of the viewer.</p>

More recent research has shown that the painting depicts Géricault himself on his deathbed, having succumbed to chronic tubercular infection at the young age of 32. Géricault’s early death and bold artistry, which sought to challenge classical notions of beauty, made him emblematic of the trope of the tragic Romantic artist. Images depicting his passing circulated throughout the 19th century, and talismanic copies of his death mask populated young artists’ studios.</p>

Bamboo-Covered Stream in Spring Rain,"Xia Chang (Chinese, 1388-1470)","Ming dynasty (1368–1644), dated 1441",1436.0,1446.0,Handscroll; ink on paper,Painting,ARTIC-12117,China,"<p>This fifty-foot composition reveals a “slit-view” perspective of bamboo growing along a stream. In single brushstrokes of varied tonality, leaves and stalks are depicted close up, cut off at top and bottom. Xia Chang executed this painting with great breadth and boldness as a gift for a friend who had planted a bamboo grove around his retirement villa.</p>
<p>As it bends without breaking, bamboo evoked human values of resiliency and endurance for intellectual painters of premodern China. Xia’s dedicatory inscription on this scroll, describing the bamboo garden as “washing away ordinary thought,” expresses their desire for retreat from the trials of official life. He had served the government in roles of calligrapher, draftsman, and administrative secretary before retiring for a decade in 1439, initially to care for his aged mother. This painting exhibits his style of angular rocks, ink-washed shoreline, and fluent brushwork that matured during that period.</p>

Although the version in this painting is nearly to scale with the original, it is more a translation than a copy, with rhythmical arabesques that are characteristic of Gauguin’s painting style rather than Cézanne’s.</p>

Here four women wrapped in shawls slowly stroll through the garden. The two closest to the viewer avert their gazes and curiously cover their mouths. Their somber outlines echo the two orange cones, which probably represent shrubs wrapped against the frost. The bench along the upper-left path rises steeply, defying logical perspective. Equally puzzling is the mysterious bush on the left, in which Gauguin consciously embedded forms that suggest eyes and a nose, creating the impression of a strange, watchful presence. With its aura of repressed emotion and elusive meaning, <em>Arlésiennes (Mistral)</em> explores the ambiguities, mysteries, and emotions that Gauguin believed underlie appearances.</p>

They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

<p>この作品は、本展覧会唯一の、16世紀の作品である。夢幻的な中国の山水が、眼前に、空間奥深く広がっている。屏風の折れにより、その効果は一層、高められている。絵の構成は、縦書きの日本の書と同様に、右から左へと展開しており、四季の移り変わりは、右隻の1年のはじまりとなる紅梅から、左隻の積雪の山へと表わされている。右隻の山寺と左隻の村落は、舟の往来する入江を取り囲んでいる。人々は、せわしなく動き回り、岩の形は、地形的にあり得ない程ねじれ、滝水は、指を広げたように、しぶきをあげている。</p>
<p>このように、中国を起源とする禅宗の信者たちが理想とした風景画とは、知性と信仰の営みを妨げられることなく探求できまた四季の一巡が自然の世界が本来もっている調和と再生を物語るような楽園を表わすものであった。&lt;/BIG&gt;</p>
<p>The artist Sesson Shukei was a Zen Buddhist monk-painter who achieved his idiosyncratic painterly style during an itinerant career in eastern Japan, seemingly without traveling to Kyoto, Japan’s cultural and political capital at the time. His <em>Landscape of the Four Seasons</em> is the only work in the exhibition from the 16th century. Sesson’s dreamlike Chinese landscape expands before our eyes in understandable spatial depth, an effect that is enhanced by the folds of the screen. We read the composition like the Japanese language, from right to left, and follow the flow of the seasons from the first red plum blossoms of the year, all the way across to the snow-covered mountains on the far left. A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.</p>
<p>For adherents of Zen Buddhism, a sect with origins in China, idealized landscapes described a world akin to paradise, in which intellectual and religious activities could be pursued unhindered and the cycle of the seasons spoke of the harmony and rebirth inherent in the natural world.</p>

From the clouds, the Olympian gods wield their attributes as weapons: Jupiter hurls thunderbolts; Neptune brandishes his triton; and Mercury uses his caduceus as a spear. The helmeted figure on the right is Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and war. The painting's gemlike effect results from the use of a copper support and from its small scale. The artist's self-conscious display of his skills was a hallmark of the international style known as Mannerism, which was fashionable in Holland around 1600.</p>

Interactions between mortals and the gods were depicted on funerary objects including papyri, like this example made for temple singer Tayu-henut-Mut (“the mistress of [the goddess] Mut”).</p>
<p>This papyrus shows Tayu-henut-Mut standing with raised hands before an offering table, praising the enthroned god Osiris, ruler of the afterlife. Behind Osiris a scribe has carefully copied spells from the Book of Going Forth by Day. First appearing during the New Kingdom (about 1550 BCE), this religious text is better known today as the Book of the Dead, because scrolls were buried with their owners. Tayu-henut-Mut’s copy includes five spells selected from nearly 200 known options to aid in her journey to eternity, including one for “causing a man to remember his name.” Egyptians believed that one would cease to exist in the afterlife if their name was forgotten or no longer spoken among the living.</p>

A loyalist, Earl fled America for England during the Revolutionary War, developing his portrait style, in turn, by studying with Benjamin West (an American painter in London) and through contact with English artists. Returning in 1785, Earl painted this portrait of Noah Smith late in his career, having melded his British training with a simpler, linear style that appealed to his clients of the rural gentry. In this work, Smith, chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, sits assuredly before the viewer; the map at hand, pastoral view at left, and volumes of books behind him signal the sitter’s prominent position as a man of affairs in the young nation.</p>

The artist had spent eighteen months in New Mexico from 1918 until he returned to New York in 1919, but he continued to paint the Southwest from memory for several years, increasingly exaggerating the dramatic terrain and brilliant hues as time passed. For Hartley, as for so many artists who visited the Southwest, the remembered landscape became a vehicle for modernist exploration of color and shape.</p>

An assertion of Native American pride and empowerment in the late 1880s, these ceremonies drew the attention of ethnographers and aroused the suspicions of United States government and military officials. After the murders of Big Foot and Sitting Bull and the massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890, the Ghost Dance became part of the mythology of the vanishing Indian. In Ralph Blakelock’s murky, deliberately ambiguous composition, the dancing figures appear as ghosts or shadows—insubstantial fragments of a memory or a dream. Indeed, the artist's understanding of such performances was drawn from accounts in newspapers and magazines. He had not traveled to the West since the early 1870s, more than 20 years before painting this work.</p>

Carrying a loaf of bread and a rosary, Giacomo sports the hat and staff of a Santiago pilgrim. The boy would have been 13 years old in 1738, when this work was likely painted.

The Old Mill,"George Inness (American, 1825–1894)",1849,1849.0,1849.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35061,United States,"<p>George Inness began painting landscapes during a period in which the public preferred depictions of the untamed American wilderness; throughout his career, however, he insisted upon the importance of the cultivated landscape as a subject for art. In this work, the brightly lit figures and mill contrast with the shadowy darkness of the trees, suggesting the potential for danger at the edge of the forest. The rundown mill represents a stable, settled area but also points to the changes brought about by industrialization. Inness thus created a contradictory view of rural life that celebrates its simplicity and safety while hinting at its decline.</p>

Peach Blossoms,"Winslow Homer (American, 1836–1910)",1878,1878.0,1878.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-34988,United States,"<p>Winslow Homer often depicted scenes of leisure in his early career. This painting features a young woman looking at burgeoning peach blossoms, indicating both early spring and perhaps her youth. The setting, which often recurs in Homer's oeuvre, reflects nostalgia for a fading rural past. Contemporary critics referred to the artist's style at this time as independent of foreign influences, suggesting an inherently American quality. However, his stylistic decisions link this work to both French and Japanese art. Impressionism inspired Homer's use of a lighter palette, and the attention to linearity in the tree is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy. The painting thus serves as visual evidence of the global artistic exchange of the late 19th century.</p>

Passing over a train line to the Paris suburb of Sceaux, the aqueduct was constructed during a period of rapid development around the French capital. Guillaumin encountered such scenes while working in security for a railroad company, a job that allowed him to travel and sketch in different places on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>Guillaumin shared this interest in the Paris suburbs with his fellow Impressionists—especially <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40482/paul-cezanne"">Paul Cezanne</a> and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/36211/camille-pissarro"">Camille Pissarro</a>, with whom he painted in the 1870s.

Holy Family,South German,1440/60,1475.0,1475.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-37523,Southern Germany,"<p>This view of the Holy Family in an interior is filled with the trappings of a comfortable bourgeois existence. Its unknown maker was probably working from a repertory of pattern drawings derived from the most innovative Netherlandish painters of the early 15th century, Rogier van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck. The pose of the Virgin and the buffet with its brass and pewter vessels are particularly indebted to their work. At the same time, the painting’s dry style and its use of a spruce rather than an oak panel for the support are indications that it was made in Southern Germany.</p>

According to the entry for this painting, the client wished to pay only for one full-length, one bust-length, and three half-length figures. Guercino’s moving composition attests to his resourcefulness in overcoming such restrictions. Christ and the attendant mourners are depicted with compelling restraint and in accord with the patron’s budget.</p>

Though the artist takes his name from the Pulkau altarpiece, he was probably active in Vienna. Like other loosely associated South German and Austrian artists of the early 16th century, who are now grouped together as the Danube School, the Master of Pulkau used exuberant natural forms to give a heightened emotional quality to his work. In this altarpiece wing, the swirling vegetation, excited angels, and oversized Virgin and animals direct the viewer’s attention to the vulnerable Christ Child, who is the focus of adoration.</p>

As the fifth-century text <em>New Account of Tales of the World</em> (Shishuo xinyu) describes, Wang awoke in the midst of a snowy night and, inspired by a glass of wine, recalled the poem “Summons to a Retired Gentleman.” He then impulsively set out in a small boat to visit his reclusive friend Dai Kui. Upon arriving at Dai’s gate, however, Wang left without entering. Asked to explain his irrational behavior, he replied, “I originally went on the strength of an impulse, and when the impulse was spent, I turned back” (translated by Richard Mather). Wang appears here huddled in his boat, which is paddled by an attendant clothed in a straw raincoat.</p>

Brilliant pigments of orange, green, and blue electrify an otherwise tranquil scene. Through color and atmosphere rather than line or detail, Inness communicated an intensity of vision, fueled by an individual encounter with nature.</p>

Monet would later follow Boudin’s practice of painting in the open air, the technique that gave this image of a beach for middle-class vacationers its vivid spontaneity and atmospheric light. This practice would be particularly important for Monet and his contemporaries, who came to be known as the Impressionists.</p>
<p>Eugène-Louis Boudin painted many beach scenes at the fashionable tourist spots of Trouville and Deauville in Normandy. In them we see the life of the Paris boulevards translated to the seashore. Bathing attire being still relatively rare, people wore the same clothes at the beach as they did in the city and made the same round of promenades, visits, and dinners. The huts on wheels are portable changing machines that were pulled into the water so that bathers could change without fear of exposure.</p>

In this portrait, Roulin rocks a cradle by pulling on a rope. The title La Berceuse (the lullaby) suggests a consoling figure, and the artist described his palette as a soothing “lullaby in colors.”</p>
<p>Van Gogh painted five versions of this image. He completed this one in January 1889, soon after returning from his stay in the hospital following Paul Gauguin’s fraught departure. Madame Roulin sits in Gauguin’s chair, an attempt by Van Gogh to fill the space left by the older artist. In May 1889, Van Gogh gave this canvas to Gauguin as a gesture of reconciliation and friendship, instructing that it be hung between two paintings of sunflowers.</p>

Adoration of the Magi,"Jan van Scorel (Netherlandish, 1495-1562)",about 1519,1515.0,1525.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-41371,Netherlands,"<p>One of Jan van Scorel’s earliest known works, this image of three kings from distant lands paying tribute to the newborn Jesus incorporates elements of northern and southern European visual traditions. The refined landscape, intricate costumes, and individualized faces of the figures attest to lessons the artist likely learned from his Netherlandish predecessors. The elaborate architectural carvings, on the other hand, recall ancient Roman wall decoration. Van Scorel likely made this work while traveling to study in Italy: the panel on which it is painted is made of fir, a wood rarely used in the Low Countries but one he might have encountered on his way across the Alps. Van Scorel was praised by the first biographer of Netherlandish artists as the “lantern bearer” who brought the Italian Renaissance style back to Northern Europe.</p>

Although trained in the rigorous French academic traditions, he often emulated the broader style of Titian, Paolo Veronese, and other Venetian Renaissance masters. For his depiction of Christ washing Saint Peter's feet just after the Last Supper (John 13:4-5), Bertin created a majestic, theatrical backdrop reminiscent of those in Veronese's pictures. Through gesture and facial expression Bertin adeptly described a range of emotions, from surprise and puzzlement to humility.</p>

Durand was a prominent figure of the Hudson River School who contributed to the rise of American landscape painting in the 1840s and 1850s. His <em>Study of Rocks in Pearson’s Ravine</em> depicts a fragment of forested terrain in the Delaware River Valley in New Jersey. The composition is an example of Durand’s intense investigation of nature, executed outdoors and with a high degree of finish and detail. The artist meticulously rendered the moss-covered stone, flowering groundcover, and botanical variety.

Apparently dissatisfied with his complex imitation of Spanish Baroque art, he cut the original painting into three sections and reconceived this portion as an individual work of art. The artist painted out part of the head of a female gypsy, replaced blue sky with a dark brown ground, and extensively reworked the figure of the boy. He then renamed the painting <em>La Régalade</em>, which means to pour liquid from a bottle down the throat without touching the lips.</p>

The Tale of Taishokan,Artist unknown (Japanese),1640-80,1635.0,1685.0,"Pair of six-panel screens; ink, colors, and gold on paper",Painting,,Japan,"<p>This screen narrates the medieval <em>Taishokan</em> tale, an action-adventure story that captivated medieval and early modern audiences whether they saw it performed on the Noh, Bunraku or Kabuki stage, or depicted in paintings and prints. The many variants of the tale combine elements from early Japanese mythology and history; 14th-century Buddhist temple origin legend (<em>engi</em>) that reflects continuing anxiety about foreign invasion in the wake of the Mongol attacks of the late 13th century, and Noh play motifs.<br>The story unfolds from right to left, opening with a scene in and around the courtyard of Fujiwara Kamatari’s residence in the Nara area. Kamatari, the most powerful courtier of the seventh century, was the first and only person ever granted the rank of ‘Taishokan,’ the highest rank in a system used only between 647 and 685. According to legend, reputation of Kamatari daughter’s beauty made its way to China, where the emperor Taizong fell in love with her sight unseen, and asked to marry her. Kamatari’s daughter, Kohakunyo, is shown boarding her carriage to be sent abroad on the ships depicted below. Her new home, the Chinese court, is shown to the left. On the left screen, the treasures that the princess sends back to Japan, the most precious of them a jewel in which is embedded a tiny statue of the Buddha, have been entrusted to the Chinese general Wanhu. Wanhu is shown in battle with the forces of the dragon king who lives beneath the sea and succeeds in stealing the precious jewel. In the end, Kamatari (in other versions, such as the Noh play <em>Ama</em> [15th c.] and Chikamatsu Monzaemon’s Bunraku play <em>Taishokan</em> [1711], it is Kamatari’s grandson Fusasaki) enlists the help of a diver woman to recover the stolen jewel. She manages to sneak into the undersea Dragon Palace, recover the jewel, and escape—pursued by the Dragon King’s horde. Just as she reaches the surface—at the very center of the screen—she is slain by one of the Dragon King’s minions, a serpent-warrior. When the men on Kamatari’s ship recover her body, they find the jewel concealed in a slit she had cut into her chest—she had knowingly sacrificed herself, that is, to recover the precious jewel.<br>For a translation of one version of the <em>Taishokan</em> story, see Melanie Trede, <em>Image, Text and Audience: The </em>Taishokan<em> Narrative in Visual Representations of the Early Modern Period</em> (Peter Lang, 2003).</p>

In either location, it was a focal point of public worship. The painter of this outstanding example was a leading Florentine artist of the middle of the 13th century, named after another painted crucifix in the Museo del Bigallo, Florence. Although his style retains the traditional linear patterning associated with Byzantine models, he employed a new, more natural system of lighting.

Remington enjoyed the soldiers' ornate costumes, and he emphasized these through the use of rhythmic, flashing colors and the depiction of brilliant light. The line of horsemen stretches off into the far distance—a sign of honor, strength, and dignity.</p>

In a departure from typically barren images of winter, he enjoyed depicting the beauty of the frozen terrain, believing that it was conducive to contemplation and regeneration. The dense, gradually built-up layers of paint in <em>Icebound</em> mimic the accumulation of snow on frozen ground, and the sinuous curves that define the snow and ice against the water suggest movement in an otherwise tranquil environment. Almost square in format, the painting’s harmonious composition exemplifies Twachtman’s opinion that “never is nature more lovely than when it is snowing.”</p>

Artists typically depicted him as a scholar in his study or as an ascetic in the wilderness, but this portrait-like image combines both themes. The books before him on the desk suggest his learned character, while the crucifix and skull he contemplates as he beats his breast with a rock evoke his hermetic activities. The saint displays the nervous, exaggerated gestures often found in work by this artist, known as the Master of the Lille Adoration.</p>

The presence of indigenous Carib, African, Afro-Creole, European, and mixed-race individuals attests to the long history of white-settler colonialism in the West Indies, where valuable crops such as coffee and sugar were cultivated through the labor of enslaved people.</p>
<p>The Italian-born artist Agostino Brunias settled on the island, painting scenes of Caribbean life for his planter-class patrons as well as white audiences abroad. Eliding the brutal conditions of slavery, his compositions shaped a reassuring vision of British imperialism for those in power. Yet by centering enslaved and free people of color—and focusing on mixed-race interactions—he also foregrounded the human impact of colonialism.</p>

They spent these years in Lower Norwood, outside London. In the neighboring town of Sydenham, Pissarro painted the glass-and-iron Crystal Palace, which was originally designed by Joseph Paxton in 1851 for London’s Hyde Park. Although it was immediately acclaimed for its modern architecture, only two years later the building was dismantled and reassembled in Sydenham. (It was destroyed by fire in 1936.) In this small oil painting, Pissarro relegated what was considered the world’s largest building to the left side of the canvas, as if to give equal space to the “modern-life” scene of families and carriages parading by Sydenham’s more recently constructed middle-class homes.</p>

He received his formative artistic training in Boston and headed to Paris in the early 1880s for further instruction. By the late 1880s, Vonnoh had settled in Grez-sur-Loing, a rural area outside of Paris that attracted a growing colony of artists who worked outdoors. Here, using a brilliant palette, broken brushstrokes, and unblended colors, Vonnoh captured the budding vegetation and warming sunlight of a spring day. Intense greens, peaches, and lavenders convey the dappled light and shadows of a winding road at right. The fence posts marking the edge of the yard and white linens hanging from a nearby tree highlight the scene’s domestic setting.</p>

Two Sisters (On the Terrace),"Pierre-Auguste Renoir (French, 1841-1919)",1881,1881.0,1881.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36351,France,"<p>“He loves everything that is joyous, brilliant, and consoling in life,” an anonymous interviewer once wrote about Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This may explain why <em>Two Sisters (On the Terrace)</em> is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting. Although the girls were not actually sisters, Renoir’s dealer showed the work with this title, along with <em>Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando</em> and others, at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882.</p>
","Despite the title, the young women in this painting were not actually sisters. The older girl in the center gazes absently beyond her younger companion, whose red cheeks suggest that she just dashed into the picture.

Jefferson dispatched the American ship <em>Enterprise</em> to the Tripolitan waters as a sign of resistance just as Tripoli increased its tribute demands and declared war against the United States. Thomas Birch, an early specialist in maritime painting, captured the battle between the <em>Enterprise</em> and a Tripolitan cruiser in the Mediterranean’s dark, violent waters.

He was largely self-taught, his only formal training from his stepfather Peter Pelham, an English artist who specialized in mezzotint engraving. Pelham encouraged Copley to produce his own mezzotints and to learn to draw by copying English prints.

The painting’s setting and title suggest that she is a courtesan in a harem. For 19th-century European artists, depicting the nude female form was a fundamental component of academic training and a benchmark of artistic excellence. The imagined harem setting—a space historically forbidden to men—provided narrative context for the nude and appealed to the sexual and colonialist fantasies of European audiences.</p>

Madame Buron was particularly supportive of David’s desire to become a painter, in opposition to her husband’s wish that he study architecture. In this intimate early portrait, David presented his aunt looking up momentarily from her reading to acknowledge the viewer with a warm reserve. Her glance suggests an affectionate bond between the painter and sitter and displays the ambitious young artist’s awareness of contemporary conventions for depicting middle-class women of sensibility.</p>

A well-known beauty, Olga Caracciolo lived in Dieppe, France, likely where this work was executed, and later married the photographer Adolf de Meyer. Rather than a swift, abbreviated study for a larger composition, Whistler considered a work such as this to be a satisfying aesthetic whole. Indeed, small paintings serve as invitations for an intimate viewing experience and contemplation of the artist’s harmonies of color and form.</p>

The horse gathers speed, spurred on by the whip of famous ringmaster Monsieur Loyal. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec may have based the garishly made-up rider, dressed in a tutu of gauze and sequins, on Suzanne Valadon, a former circus performer, model, and artist with whom he had a nearly three-year relationship. The rider seems to snarl at Monsieur Loyal, who glares back at her.

<p>(953–1034)とする書き込みもある。</p>
<p>この屏風は、表具裂に「珂憶」の字が見えることから、珂憶円信（かおくえんしん）（～1707）により、臨終を予期して注文されたと考えられている。珂憶は、江戸時代の浄土宗の指導的な役割を果たした僧侶で、徳川家の帰依を受けてアドバイザーになった。&lt;/BIG&gt;</p>
<p>An aged nun at the moment of her death sits in a small house calmly watching Amida Buddha and his retinue of bodhisattvas, dancing and playing music, approach on golden clouds. It is the belief of the Pure Land Sect (Jodo) of Buddhism that the Amida Buddha receives the souls of the recently departed and carries them back to the Western Paradise. Repeated in gold around the figures is the mantra <em>Namu Amida Butsu</em> (Hail the Amida Buddha!). By intoning this phrase over and over again, a soul could be assured of salvation. The other texts written in gold contains passages from Pure Land sutras describing the remarkable scene, and another inscription identifies the nun as Anyo (953–1034), the younger sister of the monk Genshin (also pictured), author of the landmark tract <em>Ojo yoshu</em> (The Essentials of Pure Land Rebirth).</p>
<p>Judging from the characters reading “Kaoku” on the mounting fabric, it is believed that this pair of screens was commissioned by Kaoku Enshin (d. 1707), a leading monk of the Pure Land Sect and an advisor to the Tokugawa clan, perhaps in anticipation of his own death.</p>

Corneille specialized in this stylized type of small, finely painted precious portraiture, working primarily for the court and bourgeois elite of 16th-century Lyon, France, where he lived most of his life. The sitter’s exaggerated proportions direct the viewer’s attention to his head and thus to his quiet yet self-assured expression. His confident posture and expensive clothes, along with the exceptional reputation of his portraitist, speak to his high social status.</p>

"The Departure of the Boats, Étretat","Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1885,1885.0,1885.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>Forced indoors by inclement fall weather, Claude Monet painted <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59927/boats-on-the-beach-at-etretat""><em>Boats on the Beach at Étretat</em></a> and <em>The Departure of the Boats, Étretat</em> while looking out the window of his room at the Hôtel Blanquet. The two form a pair that share a palette, subject, and vantage point. In one of his daily letters to his companion and future wife, Alice Hoschedé, dated November 24, 1885, Monet described first <em>Boats on the Beach</em> and then <em>Departure of the Boats</em>: “In the afternoon, I worked in my room on my <em>caloges</em> [retired fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain, then I attempted to do, always through the window, a picture of the boats departing.”</p>
<p>Monet centered each composition on the boats, combining pastel blues, pinks, purples, and greens to render wet surfaces. The brightly colored hulls of beached crafts lend relative scale to the structures in <em>Boats on the Beach</em>, and the groups of figures at the water’s edge, composed of quick, gestural strokes, register human activity in <em>Departure of the Boats</em>. Monet purposefully arrived well after tourist season, so it is unclear whether he observed the fashionably dressed women at left or rather inserted them as a foil to the local fishermen at right.</p>

Irises,"Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1914/17,1914.0,1926.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>Approximately six and a half feet square, <em>Irises</em> is one of a series of large paintings Claude Monet undertook during World War I experimenting with familiar motifs on an ever-expanding scale. Lacking a discernible horizon or clear sense of depth, the viewer is both on top of and submerged in this encrusted and disorienting surface, suggestive of water, on which various vegetal and floral forms float.</p>
<p>Together with other related canvases, this work remained in the artist’s Giverny studio long after his death in 1926 and was only rediscovered in the 1950s, having suffered localized damage by shrapnel from shells during World War II. In 1956 the Art Institute’s pioneering curator of modern art, Katherine Kuh, bought this painting from Katia Granoff's gallery in Paris. Kuh recognized a formal affinity between Monet’s late experimental painting and the public’s growing interest in large-scale, abstract works like those by Jackson Pollock, whose <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83642/greyed-rainbow""><em>Greyed Rainbow</em></a> entered the Art Institute’s collection in 1955.</p>

A Poem from the Shin Kokinshu with Design of Shinobugusa (Moss Fern),"Hon'ami Kōetsu (Japanese, 1558-1637)",1605-10,1605.0,1610.0,"Fragment of a handscroll mounted as a hanging scroll; ink, gold, silver-colored pigment, and mica on paper",Painting,ARTIC-70975,,"<p>Hon'ami Koetsu is regarded in Japan as an eminent calligrapher of his time, and the text of the poem he wrote here showcases his skill with alternating between thickly inked and thinly drawn characters. Together with his collaborator, Tawaraya Sotatsu, he specialized in artistic forms that evoke the elegant pastimes of courtly life, including poetry. The pair was particularly successful with a newly prosperous class of townspeople in 17th-century Kyoto who were interested in emulating their aristocratic predecessors. Tawaraya and his studio produced these <em>shinobugusa</em> (moss fern) designs by using real foliage to print with silver and gold ink rhythmically across the paper.</p>
<p>The poem comes from the 1205 anthology <em>Shin Kokinshu</em> (New Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern) and is attributed to Fujiwara Tadahira (880–949), also known as Sadanobu. Within the publication, the verses are preceded by a note that reads, “Sending a spray of plum flowers to his brother Nakahira on the occasion of his being appointed to the Minister of the Left.” The poem itself gives the impression that the poet’s brother has achieved a rank after a long period of effort. The references to plum blossoms set the scene in late winter or early spring. They could also be an allusion to Sugawara Michizane, a great scholar who is regarded as the god of learning and whose symbol is the plum.</p>

The sitter appears frozen in a somewhat unnatural pose, as was the fashion for half-length portraits at the time, and the positioning of his left hand on the painting’s lower edge recalls the spatial illusionism found in portraits by Netherlandish artists of the previous generation. However, the subtle modeling of the face conveys a strong sense of the sitter’s individual character at a time when such works tended to idealize their subjects. The pink, or carnation, held by the sitter could symbolize marriage or Jesus Christ’s incarnation.</p>

In these works, he simplified his palette, employed more vibrant colors, and used a thicker, broader paint application than he had earlier. Here he explored the use of complementary colors—yellow and purple, blue and orange, and red and green—in the service of chromatic intensity. The effect of these color contrasts is heightened by the pulsating pattern of brushstrokes that defines the tablecloth and creates a force field around the fruit. The painting was probably among the “violent still lifes”—to quote Van Gogh’s friend the painter <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/33617"">Emile Bernard</a>—that he included in the group exhibition of young avant-garde artists that he organized at a local restaurant in November–December 1887.</p>

While he also painted coastal and pastoral scenes, Hassam often focused on urban areas such as his hometown of Boston, and New York City, where he lived after returning from Paris. Here the artist rendered New York with short brushstrokes that emphasize the movement and activity of everyday life on Fifth Avenue along Central Park. He incorporated vivid colors, such as the red and yellow of the woman's hat and skirt, into what would otherwise be a predominantly gray and white winter cityscape and captured the light in a natural manner, presenting a picturesque view of a modern metropolis.</p>

Here Scipio demonstrates his leadership by acting with restraint (“continence”) in refusing to hold a woman as a captive of war. According to the story on which the painting is based, the woman’s fiancé, shown kneeling beside her, was a powerful prince who agreed to a military alliance with Scipio in gratitude for his lenience. The theatrical setting and costumes—the invented military helmets, anachronistically dressed characters, fanciful architecture, and gravity-defying drapery, for example— suggest that the artist’s aims were allegorical rather than historical, intended above all to illustrate for viewers the virtues of compassionate diplomacy.</p>

According to the Chicago collector Arthur Jerome Eddy (portrait nearby), the artist painted this seascape while boating off the coast as a crewman steadied their vessel. This could account for the unusually broad handling of paint and thick touches of pigment apparent throughout the composition, particularly in the clouds and gently cresting waves. Even toward the end of his life, Whistler demonstrated his enduring passion for the myriad relationships of color offered by the ever-changing sea.</p>

It was executed on poplar, a type of wooden support common in Italy, and its elongated format suggests that it was set into paneling as part of a room decoration. The painting celebrates two aristocratic pastimes, jousting and hunting; Scorel used a 1506 woodcut by <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/34071/lucas-cranach-the-elder"">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> as the model for the lively crowd watching the joust. Italian patrons were particularly drawn to the Northern European vision of chivalric subjects and courtly pursuits, and the jousting theme was no doubt requested of the young Dutch painter, who showed a talent for combining small active figures in a landscape setting.</p>

As is typical of Cezanne’s work, the painting is carefully considered and the composition hard won: the traces of at least three other pieces of fruit (presumably oranges) at lower left and near the vase attest to the artist’s changing opinion as he struggled to make the arrangement work.

Head of a Philosopher,"Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (Italian, 1727-1804)",1758/64,1758.0,1764.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36973,Italy,"<p>Giandomenico Tiepolo collaborated with his father and artistic tutor, Giambattista, on his greatest projects, including the decoration of the Royal Palace in Madrid (1762–64). After his father’s death in 1770, Giandomenico emerged as a highly original artist who was particularly adept at depicting popular activities and amusements in a humorous manner. This is one of a group of fanciful heads of philosophers that the artist executed in response to a similar painted series by Giambattista from 1757–58. Despite its source, Giandomenico’s lighter, more dashing work represents a distinct departure from his father’s style.</p>

Cyrus, shown here in blue, refused even to gaze upon the beautiful queen, choosing instead to concentrate on affairs of state and turning her care over to his friend Araspas, who ultimately fell in love with her to tragic consequences. La Hyre’s take on this tale of the conflict between love and civic duty was probably made as part of a suite of decorations for a reception room or a private cabinet in a Parisian townhouse.</p>

The Spanish introduced tobacco into Northern Europe in the 16th century, and smoking quickly became a beloved pastime that was widely considered healthful and nourishing. By the early 17th century, single-figure images of smokers emerged as a subgenre of Dutch and Flemish painting. The theme posed an enticing challenge for artists, with its burning leaves, billowing plumes of smoke, and active facial expressions—here, the figure purses his lips and wrinkles his brow as he concentrates on lighting the pipe. German painter Johann Carl Loth blended the Northern emphasis on capturing textures with the dramatic illumination reminiscent of so-called Caravaggesque painters like <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/51341/hendrick-terbrugghen"">Hendrick Terbrugghen</a>.</p>

Retable and Frontal of the Life of Christ and the Virgin Made for Pedro López de Ayala,Spanish,1396,1396.0,1396.0,Tempera and gold on panel,Painting,,Spain,"<p>This remarkable ensemble is made up of a retable, which was set up behind the altar table, and a frontal, which decorated the front of the table itself. The work is literally a testament to the piety of Pedro López de Ayala, a major figure in the political and cultural life of late medieval Spain. He was a courtier, soldier, and diplomat in the service of the kings of Castile, eventually serving as chancellor; he also wrote poetry, a treatise on hunting, and important chronicles of his era.</p>
<p>Ayala expected his altarpiece to be a perpetual plea for his eternal salvation and that of his family. Indeed, for more than five hundred years, it decorated the family’s funerary chapel in their fortified palace in northern Spain. Ayala was careful to declare his donation of the altarpiece in honor of Christ and the Virgin Mary through the inscription that runs across the bottom margin; the images of himself and his wife, Leonora de Guzman, kneeling in prayer with their son and daughter-in-law at either end of the lower register; and their coats of arms — two wolves and two cauldrons —  alternating around the frames.</p>
<p>The massive altarpiece must have been constructed and painted inside the small chapel. To accomplish this, Ayala called upon local artists, who created a series of scenes that tell the stories of the life of Christ and the Virgin and center on images of the Crucifixion and of an empty throne that probably once framed a statue of the Virgin and Child. These scenes are not projections of convincing pictorial space. Rather, with their plain backgrounds and framing arcades, they hark back to earlier architectural decoration and manuscript illumination. The altarpiece was clearly intended to impress through its monumental scale, its narrative clarity, and its costly materials, which include gold and silver leaf and glazes of rare and expensive ultramarine blue.</p>

"Wine, Cheese, and Fruit","John F. Francis (American, 1808-1886)",1857,1857.0,1857.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-44823,Pennsylvania,"<p>Succulent grapes, crumbling cheese, sparkling wine in elegant glasses, and cognac in tumblers are depicted in this opulent dessert picture by John Francis. Originally an itinerant portrait painter, Francis turned to still life in the mid-19th century when the availability of daguerreotype portraits rendered his trade obsolete. The penchant for household embellishment among the Victorian middle class created a lively market for still-life paintings, which were often hung in dining rooms. While spirits are featured prominently in this painting, the glasses that are less than half full and the presence of the water indicate balance and restraint, referring to the mid-century growth of the temperance movement, which promoted the ideals of moderation and self-control.</p>

Altarpiece from Thuison-les-Abbeville: Saint Hugh of Lincoln,French (Picardy),1490/1500,1490.0,1500.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-46234,France,"<p>This panel was once part of the <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=panels+from+the+high+altar&artist_ids=French+School&classification_ids=oil+on+panel"">altarpiece</a> decorating the high altar of the Carthusian monastery at Thuison, outside of Abbeville in northern France. Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived.  The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.</p>
<p>A rich border region north of Paris, Picardy was a possession of the Burgundian Netherlands in the mid-15th century, becoming part of France in 1477. Its painters were strongly influenced by artists from the neighboring provinces of the Low Countries, among them Rogier van der Weyden and Simon Marmion.</p>

Still Life No. 15,"Marsden Hartley (American, 1877–1943)",c. 1917,1917.0,1917.0,Oil on composition board,Painting,ARTIC-34853,United States,"<p>Marsden Hartley turned to still-life painting throughout his career, restlessly using the genre as a means of aesthetic experimentation as he worked out new ideas, styles, and motifs. During the 1910s, influenced by the works of Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso, he produced numerous compositions, including <em>Still Life No. 15</em>, a spare arrangement of a white goblet holding a lone pink flower against a backdrop of cream and blue fabric. Unlike many works by Hartley from this period, which emphasize the two-dimensionality of his canvases, here he conveyed a sense of the shallow dark space behind the arrangement on its skewed tabletop. Using a dry, brushy style, Hartley suggested the volumetric presence of the objects through the shading that accentuates the form of the goblet and the deep folds of the fabric.</p>

In <em>For Sunday’s Dinner</em>, a chicken hangs in front of a painted door with its throat cut and most of its feathers plucked; a few remaining downy spots stand out against the puckered, pimpled flesh. The metal door hinges, on the right side of the canvas, frame the chicken and echo its form. The painting’s title and the rough, blemished surface of the door suggest a country dinner, the homey meal evoking nostalgia for a simpler past.</p>

A representation of Christ after the Crucifixion, a type characterized as the &quot;Man of Sorrows,&quot; probably filled the lost left-hand panel and would have been the object of the tearful gazes of Mary and John and also of the meditation of the diptych’s owner. The textured gold background suggests that the figures exist in a visionary space, suited to the meditative function of the ensemble. The painting’s style and its underdrawing suggest that it may be the work of one of Jacob Cornelisz.’s close associates, an artist who has been named for a sketchbook preserved in Berlin.</p>

Monet first exhibited this painting at the Impressionist exhibition of 1876, the second of eight independent exhibitions he mounted with a group of like-minded avant-garde artists who sought to present their work outside of France’s traditional, state-sponsored Salon system.</p>

A cool light illuminates the rosy-cheeked women and casts deep shadows around Milton’s ghostly figure and face. Fuseli created this painting for his Milton Gallery, a self-run enterprise that showcased the artist’s Milton-inspired works.

In keeping with his art-for-art’s-sake creed, these works capture the stillness of evening while evoking the artistry of music. Unlike his earlier marine paintings, the subject of this work—an inlet along the English Channel near Southampton—is obscured by the approaching night. Large shipping vessels appear as ghostly shapes, reduced to shadowy forms by the deepening twilight, while the only points of brightness come from the subtle reflections of lights and the fragmented orb of the moon. The setting thus serves primarily as a vehicle for Whistler’s interest in the tonal harmonies of darkness.</p>

Although Eugène Delacroix did not visit North Africa until 1832, he began painting Orientalist subjects early on in his career. The artist’s French audience would have been receptive to his choice of jewel-like colors to describe the shimmering, gold-braided vest and billowing robes of the central figures. Far from accurately representing the attire of the 17th-century combatants of Byron’s poem, Delacroix drew upon styles worn by the Turko-Egyptian Mameluke warriors during Napoleon Bonaparte’s military campaign in Egypt in 1798–99.</p>

Fish (Still Life),"Édouard Manet (French, 1832-1883)",1864,1864.0,1864.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35577,France,"<p>Although still-life ensembles were an important element in many of the major paintings of the avant-garde artist Édouard Manet, his most sustained interest in the genre itself was from 1864 to 1865, when Fish was painted. Manet’s focus on still lifes coincided with the gradual reacceptance of the genre during the nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of the middle class, whose tastes ran to intimate, moderately priced works. This painting, like many of Manet’s still-life compositions, recalls seventeenth-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision displayed in the canvas, however, suggest why the public found Manet’s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While Fish is indeed an image of “dead nature” (nature morte is the French term for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of paint vigorous. Further enliven-ing the composition is the placement of the carp, which offsets the strong diagonal of the other elements. Manet never submitted his still lifes to the official French Salon but rather sold them through the burgeoning network of art galleries in Paris and gave them to friends.</p>

Are They Thinking about the Grape? (Pensent-ils au raisin?),"François Boucher (French, 1703-1770)",1747,1747.0,1747.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40453,France,"<p>This painting is based on a 1745 pantomime about a young shepherd’s awakening love for a shepherdess. The couple feed each other grapes—a fruit associated with Bacchus, god of pleasure—suggesting that their encounter is not entirely chaste. François Boucher’s compositions on pastoral themes comprise his most influential contribution to 18th-century French art. These lush and playful fantasies of rustic life, designed primarily for the private enjoyment of wealthy financiers and aristocrats, had little to do with the social realities of rural labor during the period.</p>

Landscape of the Four Seasons,"Sesson Shukei (Japanese, 1504-about 1589)",c. 1560,1501.0,1600.0,Pair of six-fold screens; ink and light color on paper,Painting,ARTIC-23566,Japan,"<p>Sesson Shukei was a Zen Buddhist monk and painter who achieved his idiosyncratic painterly style during an itinerant career in eastern Japan, seemingly without ever traveling to Kyoto, Japan’s cultural and political capital at the time. Sesson’s dream-like Chinese landscape expands before our eyes in understandable spatial depth, an effect that is enhanced by the folds of the screen. Reading the composition in the same manner as the Japanese language, from right to left, the seasons flow from the first red plum blossoms of the year, depicted on the right side of the right screen (top), all the way across to the snow-covered mountains on the far left side of the left screen (bottom). A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.</p>
<p>For adherents of Zen Buddhism, a sect with origins in China, idealized landscapes described a world akin to paradise, in which intellectual and religious activities could be pursued unhindered and the cycle of the seasons symbolized the harmony and rebirth inherent in the natural world.</p>

This work was one of a set of allegories of five virtues intended as decorations set above doors in a palace belonging to the king of Savoy, a region in northwest Italy. Francesco de Mura spent most of his career in Naples but also worked for the king of Savoy in the 1740s, producing paintings in a style that combined grand, calm figures with active drapery. Although it is now rectangular, the canvas shows signs of an earlier curved shape appropriate to a Rococo room decoration.</p>

The conflict included a massacre in the Al-Azhar Mosque of Mamelukes, a military class of enslaved men who occupied much of the Middle East at that time. As there were no surviving eyewitness reports, Girodet was free to interpret the event as he wished, and, as a commission from Napoleon, the painting celebrates the French point of view. Throughout the work, Girodet perpetuates European fantasies of the Middle East as simultaneously opulent and brutal, lavishing attention on Arab and Ottoman turbans, luxurious fabrics, bare flesh, and gore.</p>

It is one of a group of landscapes featuring the Butte Montmartre, a short climb from the apartment on the rue Lepic where Vincent and Theo lived. Montmartre was dotted with reminders of its quickly receding rural past—abandoned quarries, kitchen gardens, and three surviving windmills, including the Moulin de Blute-Fin. The nonfunctional mill had become a tourist attraction, affording spectacular panoramic views over Paris from the observation tower erected beside it.</p>

Christ Carrying the Cross,"Sebastiano del Piombo  (Italian, about 1485-1547)",about 1515/1517,1515.0,1517.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-41499,,"<p>This painting represents one of the most popular compositions invented by one of the most distinguished painters working in Rome during the High Renaissance. In the 1510s, following an early period in Venice, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively atmosphere of competition between the two great luminaries of the period, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for some of Sebastiano’s major commissions. Following Raphael’s death in 1520, the painter and historian Giorgio Vasari stated that “first place in the art of painting was unanimously granted by all, thanks to the favor of Michelangelo, to Sebastiano.”</p>
<p><em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em> draws upon recent developments of an enormously popular iconography by artists including Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna, among others. Here, Simon of Cyrene assists Jesus, emphasizing the heavy weight of the cross on his shoulders. A Roman soldier stands behind, his jeering face just visible in the darkness. In the background, the tightly packed composition opens up onto a crowd assembling at the foot of the hill of Golgotha, with two crosses barely visible. The luminous landscape is a hallmark of the artist’s Venetian training. The painting’s dramatic visual impact is a result of the powerful diagonals of the cross; the dynamic, almost sculptural quality of Christ’s clothing; and the pathos of his expression.</p>
<p>The popularity of Sebastiano’s composition is reflected in the number of surviving variants that he created over the course of his career. The Art Institute’s version is an autograph replica of a painting—now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid—made for Jerónimo Vich y Valterra, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. Other versions survive in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, Madrid; and the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest.</p>

The valley’s inhabitants, who had fled from political turmoil six centuries earlier, are unaware of subsequent events in the outside world. Blossoming peach trees, symbolic of immortality, conceal the entrance to their secluded paradise.</p>
<p>In depicting this mythic tale, many artists utilized a traditional palette of finely ground mineral pigments-azurite blue and malachite green- to evoke this jewel-like land. Qiu Ying was a renowned master of this “blue-and-green technique.

Returning to painting in 1504, he looked to the most lyrical and harmonious recent works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo to form his own style, which was characterized by a new, quiet spirituality. The palette of saturated blue, red, and green announces the Holy Family, while the muted tones of the angels’ garments establish an otherworldly presence. Here he treated the Nativity in a traditional, though especially intimate, manner. The Virgin kneels humbly as she gazes at the Christ Child, while Joseph assumes a pose of restrained wonderment, as if suddenly aware of the infant’s divine nature. The family shelters in a rustic stall erected within the ruins of an edifice understood to be the palace of David at Bethlehem. This juxtaposition of architecture symbolizes Christ’s establishment of his new church on the Old Testament order of the Jews. Reinforcing this device is a young tree springing from a remnant of ancient stones directly above the infant.</p>

However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman’s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman’s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt’s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.</p>

Between 1910 and 1914 he produced “improvisations,” works he described as unconscious, spontaneous expressions. Kandinsky commented on <em>Improvisation No. 30 (Cannons)</em> in a letter to Arthur Jerome Eddy, a friend and collector from Chicago: “The cannons . . . could probably be explained by the constant war talk going on through the year [but] the true contents are what the spectator experiences while under the effect of the forms and color combinations of the picture.”</p>
","In his 1912 book <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em>, Vasily Kandinsky advocated for an art that could move beyond imitation of the physical world, inspiring, as he put it, “vibrations in the soul.” Between 1910 and 1914 he produced a series of “improvisations,"" which he described as unconscious, spontaneous expressions.

Street Scenes in Times of Peace 太平風會圖,"Zhu Yu (Zhu Junbi) 朱玉（朱君璧） (Chinese, 1293-1365)","Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), 14th century 元朝",1293.0,1365.0,Handscroll; ink and colors on paper,Painting,ARTIC-79635,China,"<p>This impressive handscroll depicts more than four hundred figures that together represent a broad variety of professional occupations, social types, public interactions and expressive poses. The scroll is a rare example of genre painting, seemingly newly emerged during the Song dynasty (960-1279), that took the public activities of common people as its subject-matter. The title, added in the frontispiece to the painting, literally reads “Collection of Customs during Times of Peace” (Taiping fenghui), referring to the totality of social and professional activities of a given community. The absence of an articulated background to the depiction of these activities, and their general composition around typological groups, is a feature shared with the medium of the model-book. Such painting manuals provided a collection of iconographic cartouches for copying into larger, integrated compositions. However, the particular compositional features of this scroll, including complex interaction among groups of figures, overall spatial coherence, and the nature of activities portrayed (including transportation, performance, and public sales), interestingly suggest that its horizontal pictorial surface stands here for the public space of the ‘street’. Activities portrayed include the transportation of goods, livestock, and people, commercial activities, including divinatory and clerical services, public entertainment, and even the accidental entertainment provided by a runaway donkey causing a stir. The social array of characters runs the gamut from street-beggar to scholarly recluse (with staff and servant carrying a lute), from men to women and children. Some of the hats and clothing of these figures appear to be Mongol in type, which lends additional interest to the temporal context of production of this particular painting: if painted in the Ming, the reference to the Mongol presence during the preceding Yuan dynasty adds a retrospective, historicizing note to this portrayal of public life.</p>

<p>Jusepe de Ribera was born near Valencia, Spain, but worked in Italy, in Rome from about 1612 until 1613, when the influence of the painter Caravaggio was at its height, then in Naples from 1616. In Naples, which was then under Spanish rule, he enjoyed the patronage of successive Spanish viceroys, producing altarpieces and paintings of classical subjects and expressive single figures like the one seen here, so lifelike in their conception that they appear to be portraits of their historical or religious subjects.</p>

In this sect of Buddhism, images of patriarchs were especially revered because the relationships between masters and disciples are of primary importance to the transmission of Zen teachings. Zen’s semilegendary founder, Daruma (A.D. c. 470–c. 543), came from southern India and crossed the Yangzi River in China, where he meditated in a cave at the Shaolin monastery for nine years.

The Tale of Genji,Artist Unknown (Japanese),Early 17th century,1599.0,1699.0,"Pair of six-panel screens; ink, colors, and gold on paper",Painting,,Japan,"<p>This pair of folding screens depicts a few scenes from The Tale of Genji, a long novel written in the 11th century by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu. Even though they take place at different times in the story, the selected episodes are set in one continuous landscape. On the far right, the baby Genji is presented to his father, the emperor, for the first time. Across the bottom of the left screen, court ladies argue about which season is the most beautiful. Above, in the upper left corner, Genji and his love, Lady Murasaki, share an intimate moment in front of a charcoal brazier. The painter may have chosen these scenes fo their felicitous overtones. The overall character of the screens suggests that they were intended to be part of a bride’s wedding trousseau, which would accompany her to her new home.</p>

<p>The gold bridge spanning the twelve panels of this pair is a quintessential folding screen subject, and several versions of this design exist. The location pictured is Uji, an area of great spiritual significance and a link between the ancient cities of Nara and Kyoto. By the Edo period (1615–1868), certain elements were sufficient to evoke the famous site: the curved bridge, willows, moon, waterwheel, trailing mist, and rock-filled baskets are all elements taken from classical poetry.<br>The artist Hasegawa Soya was the son of Hasegawa Tohaku (1539–1610), an innovator in producing dynamic large-format works. An impressive amount of precious materials went into the fabrication of this pair. Gold and silver were used in leaf form on the bridge and moon, as cut squares and dust in the clouds, and as paint for the lines of the current. Gold paint has also been used over oyster-shell-white pigment (<em>gofun</em>) to create a raised effect in the baskets and the waterwheel. In addition, the application of the gold leaf diagonally to accentuate the curve of the bridge is a rare feature.</p>

Roesen worked in Pennsylvania, supported by German immigrants who operated local breweries there.

For the next three years, Wollaston worked in New York, executing numerous portraits for area sitters eager to acquire quality likenesses from a skilled, European-trained artist—a rarity in mid-18th-century America. Wollaston rendered his figures with convincing modeling and forms, excelling in the depiction of colorful draperies. In <em>Portrait of a Woman</em>, as in his other works of the time, the artist employed formulaic poses, gestures, and dress, a result, in part, of looking to English sources for portraiture, but also a means of meeting the many requests for commissions. Beginning in 1753, Wollaston painted in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina.</p>

He also revisited an Impressionist subject that his colleagues had all but abandoned by the 1890s—the modern city. This bustling scene, alive with the noise and movement of traffic and pedestrians, was the view from his window at the Hôtel Garnier in Paris, where he stayed for a few weeks early in 1893. The building at the left edge of the canvas is the Gare Saint-Lazare.</p>

Tiny white dots of shell-white pigment (<em>gofun</em>) form a patterned surface across the full heads of grain. Viewers who sat on tatami mats surrounded by these screens would have felt as if the billowing mass of each field was like a comfortable blanket that they could pull over themselves at night.<br>The pairing of the sun and the moon on screens dates back several centuries and carries Buddhist, Daoist, and Shinto associations. But its combination with edible grains, as seen here, is a 16th-century innovation that is perhaps the result of improved farming technologies and seed strains that caused agricultural yields to increase.<br><strong>Rotation 2: August 15-September 27, 2009</strong></p>

Throughout, Steenwijck emphasizes contrasts between father and son: age and youth, light and dark, peace and chaos.

Saint George and the Dragon,"Bernat Martorell (Spanish, about 1400-1452)",1434/35,1434.0,1435.0,Tempera on panel,Painting,ARTIC-16414,Spain,"<p>Bernat Martorell was the greatest painter of the first half of the fifteenth century in Catalonia in northeastern Spain. Depicted here is the most frequently represented episode from the popular legend of Saint George, in which the model Christian knight saves a town and rescues a beautiful princess. Conceived in the elegant, decorative International Gothic style, the painting was originally the center of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint George that was apparently made for the chapel of the palace of the Catalan government in Barcelona. This central scene was surrounded by four smaller narrative panels, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was probably surmounted by a lost image of Christ on the Cross. Here Saint George, on his white steed, triumphs over the evil dragon. A wealth of precisely observed details intensifies the drama. Dressed in an ermine-lined robe, the princess wears a sumptuous gilt crown atop her wavy red-gold hair. Her parents and their subjects watch the spectacle from the distant town walls. George’s halo and armor and the scaly body of the dragon are richly modeled with raised stucco decoration. Martorell also treated the ground, littered with bones and crawling with lizards, in a lively manner, giving it a gritty texture.</p>

Crucifixion,"María Josefa Sánchez (Spanish, active 1639-1649)",1646,1646.0,1646.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-115812,Spain,"<p>This fine example of a small cross made for individual worship is also exceptional because it is signed by a woman artist, María Josefa Sánchez. Sánchez was active from 1639 to 1649, probably in Castile, but little else is known about her. Women rarely worked as professional artists in 17th-century Spain; those few who did usually trained in the workshops of their fathers. Some women artists of the period, Sánchez included, may have been nuns who produced devotional works for monastic communities.</p>
<p>Here the body of Jesus is gracefully posed in contrast to his agonized expression, with carefully depicted drops of blood spilling from his hands and feet. The glowing orbs near his hands represent the sun and the moon, a reference to the darkness of the eclipse at the moment of his death. Unusually for Crucifixion scenes, Sánchez included the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, identified by the celestial symbols that surround her, at Christ’s feet.</p>

<p>The shadowed effect in the figures surrounding the Virgin and Child indicate that Piero altered his plans for the composition after he had begun painting: the artist painted them on top of the dark background color, which shows through the thin layers of paint on the surface.</p>

By 1746 he was appointed court painter to the elector of Saxony in Dresden, who commissioned him to produce cityscapes. Bellotto was subsequently asked to create 11 large-scale paintings of the nearby town of Pirna; the present picture is a reduced but otherwise exact replica of one of those celebrated works. Exalted in Bellotto’s cold, crystalline light, the fortress of Sonnenstein presides over the scene from its hilltop. In the left foreground, townsfolk congregate at a small obelisk that bears the arms of Saxony.</p>

In one of his most poignant poems, he compared the fleeting traces of human events to the footprints of geese (hong) left on snow (xue).</p>
<p>The windows of the foreground building offer glimpses of the owner’s library and art collection: bronze and ceramic vessels, one painting rolled and stored upright, a desk for painting and calligraphy, and a tall, narrow stand for burning incense.   An attendant prepares tea for gentlemen engaged in conversation in the pavilion, while women stroll in the adjacent bamboo garden. Large, eroded rocks are dramatically shaded to highlight their fantastic quality.</p>
<p>Qian’s reserved, quietly spontaneous brushwork—bland, single-stroke architecture and ink-dots that echo the contours of hills, rocks, and trees—is inspired by the style of late 16th-century literati masters, with whom the affluent and well-traveled Qian Du was undoubtedly familiar.</p>

Polycrates, ruler of the island of Samos, worried that he was tempting fate with his great prosperity. He tried to introduce some counterbalancing misfortune into his life by throwing a precious signet ring into the sea, but it was swallowed by a large fish and returned to the king by a fisherman, the episode shown here.

In the Sea,"Arnold Böcklin (Swiss, 1827-1901)",1883,1883.0,1883.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-33320,Switzerland,"<p>Arnold Böcklin’s art had little in common with Impressionism or the academic art of his time. Instead, his depictions of demigods in naturalistic settings interpret themes from Classical mythology in an idiosyncratic, often sensual manner. <em>In the Sea</em>, part of a series of paintings of mythological subjects, displays an unsettling, earthy realism. Mermaids and tritons frolic in the water with a lusty energy and abandon verging on coarseness. Occupying the center of the composition is a harpplaying triton. Three mermaids have attached themselves to his huge frame as if it were a raft; the one near his shoulder seems to thrust herself upon him. The work’s sense of boisterousness is tempered by the ominously shaped reﬂection of the triton and mermaids in the sea and by the oddness of the large-eared heads that emerge from the water at the right. In addition to imaginative, bizarre interpretations of the Classical world, Böcklin painted mysterious landscapes punctuated by an occasional lone figure. These haunting later works made him an important contributor to the international Symbolist movement. They also appealed to some Surrealist artists, particularly <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/40490/giorgio-de-chirico"">Giorgio de Chirico</a>, who declared, “Each of [Böcklin’s] works is a shock.”</p>

Why, then, we might wonder, would he choose to hang a painting off axis, where its edges imply dynamic diagonals?

In <em>Lozenge Composition</em>, the squared-off black lines imply enclosure, while a single line (above the blue area) extends to the slanted edge, suggesting extension beyond the canvas. This implication of what might lie beyond also prompted Mondrian to invoke the full expanse of the wall by hanging diagonal paintings well above eye level.</p>

Yang Pu Moving His Family,Artist Unknown (Chinese),Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) 元朝,1279.0,1368.0,Handscroll; ink and light color on paper,Painting,,China,"<p>With a lively combination of realism and caricature, this detail of the painting <em>Yang Pu Moving His Family</em> depicts a group of peasants transporting a rustic scholar and his family across a stream. Distinguished by his official government cap, with its long streamers, the otherwise disheveled, bare-legged scholar bids farewell to his neighbors on the shore. Servants valiantly attempt to carry children and the family’s belongings—scrolls, furniture, and dishes—through the water. The scholar depicted here may represent Yang Pu, a character described in stories of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). According to folklore, Yang Pu initially declined, and then reluctantly accepted, his appointment to a government position in the capital city. Chinese law forbade civil officials from working in their native districts, and as a result, many were required to relocate to distant cities. Painters and poets frequently depicted the theme of farewell, or “noble parting,” exemplified by the story of Yang Pu. The twigs that protrude from the official caps of the men depicted here may allude to the ancient Chinese custom of presenting departing friends with small branches from a willow tree.</p>

The artist is known to have acquired corpses from his local morgue to study anatomy and the effects of decomposition. Surrounding himself with the stench of decay, he produced several paintings of decapitated heads and severed limbs. By depicting this graying and lifeless head upon on a blood-stained cloth laid over a wooden table, Géricault also referenced—perhaps ironically—the long history of still-life painting in Western art. The head probably belonged to a convicted criminal. At that time in France, executions were carried out by the guillotine, a bladed device that sliced through the necks of its victims.</p>

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived.  The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.</p>

Berchem executed scenes of the Italian <em>campagna</em> (countryside) for cosmopolitan collectors who appreciated foreign views. Against the muddy palette used for the livestock, Berchem highlighted the shepherdess’s skirt with a vibrant blue, a color that attracts the eye of the viewer and of the young shepherd nearby. Alongside paintings of the flat but fertile Dutch landscape, collectors enjoyed fanciful depictions of Italy for their hilly terrain and playful peasants.</p>

One of several paintings he commissioned from Ingres, this portrait highlights the nobleman’s status and swagger. Posing confidently in his finest garments and wearing a medal of the Order of the Legion of Honor, he gazes directly at the viewer with a stern expression. Light glints off his gold ring and accentuates the exquisite detail of his sword’s hilt. Ingres enhanced the sumptuous elegance of this scene through elongated forms and skillful application of color, setting Amédée-David’s peachy flesh against a forest-green satin wall and curtain.</p>

Although best known as a painter of religious subjects, Deshays often employed the soft, highly fluid manner that Boucher used for his amorous “boudoir” pictures. In fact, this work was for a long time believed to be by Boucher. The subject of the painting derives from the Gospel of Matthew: seated before the multitude and with arms dramatically outstretched, John the Baptist warns, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</p>

Shaw excelled at painting Romantic scenes of imaginary Arcadian landscapes. In <em>Solitude</em>, a male figure reclines in the foreground, with the contemplative pose and seminude state of a poet or philosopher inspired by the beauty of nature. In addition to idealized compositions such as this one, Shaw painted landscapes in watercolor based on observations of various locales along the Eastern Seaboard. Shaw was a generation older than <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/34007"">Thomas Cole</a> and other artists of the country’s first school of landscape painting, the Hudson River School, which emerged in the second quarter of the 19th century.</p>

Portrait of a Man in Costume,"Jean-Honoré Fragonard (French, 1732-1806)",1768/70,1768.0,1770.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-40583,France,"<p>Jean-Honoré Fragonard is perhaps best known for his light-hearted, amorous subjects, which seem to embody the spirit of eighteenth-century France. This work, painted in lively brushstrokes, represents another important aspect of Fragonard’s genius—in a series of fantasy portraits, he used references to earlier artists to enliven his own characterizations of his patrons and artistic friends. Here the identity of the sitter is unknown; however, the half-length format, the rapid, virtuoso handling of the paint, and the use of seventeenth-century costume link this work to the fantasy portraits. In this instance, Fragonard took as his starting point a painting of an actor by the Italian Baroque artist Domenico Fetti, then in a leading Parisian collection; in other related portraits, the French painter was inspired by the bravura style of the Flemish artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. Two paintings from this series bear inscriptions stating that they were painted in one hour. Whether or not this is literally true, the direct, personal quality that results from Fragonard’s command of the medium makes this series particularly appealing to a modern sensibility.</p>

The work’s deliberately provocative title enhances this effect, leaving us to wonder if the “you” refers to someone in the painting or to the viewer.</p>

This work depicts New Hampshire’s White Mountains, an area that Cole traveled to and painted on numerous occasions, as did other 19th-century landscape artists. The prominent church spire at middle distance emphasizes the role of religion in agrarian society and the glow of the low sun expresses a sense of optimism for a rural America. The painting conveys an ideal that was increasingly far from reality, however, as the United States was then being transformed by rapid urbanization and the Industrial Revolution.</p>

The table around which they are posed displays many of the still-life elements that are arranged in a natural, random fashion in this work.

The first painting shows Jerome’s dream of being punished by a heavenly council for preferring ancient Greek and Roman texts to the Christian Bible. In the second painting, Saint Augustine sits at his desk composing a eulogy for Jerome when he is interrupted by a vision of the scholar-saint accompanied by John the Baptist, who praises Jerome as his equal. Matteo di Giovanni hinted at this connection in The Dream of St. Jerome by including a scene of baptism in the archway above Jerome’s head. Such cross-references between artworks and texts are a hallmark of 15th-century Italian painting and served to engage the viewer in active, contemplative looking.</p>

The hilt of the sword on the table suggests that this gentleman held a position in the military, perhaps one with an administrative or legal component, as indicated by the statue in the background of the Roman goddess Justitia, with her scales and sword. The man’s success is demonstrated not only by this large sculpture but also by the golden cloak he wears. Such luxury garments were imported from Japan at mid-century, but this fashionable, brocaded version was likely made domestically. Caspar Netscher, one of the great small-scale Dutch portraitists, would have made this painting for display in a home.</p>

The white multi-armed goddess at the center is the largest and most powerful figure and is probably White Tara (the Savioress); she has a third eye and holds a lotus in each of her 18 hands. The goddess is flanked by two bird-headed female attendants, one blue and one green, each wearing a necklace of human skulls and trampling a nude male figure (a symbol of ignorance). These are probably <em>dakinis,</em> tantric sky dancers who play a supportive role helping humans to overcome ignorance. This type of banner was and still is displayed outdoors, often on the walls of a temple, during festivals.</p>

In Rabbit Warren, snow covers the ground, houses, and vegetation in a frothy coat that resulted from the artist’s vigorous brushwork. Throughout, small spots of color in the chimneys, greenish shrubs, and clothing of the man at right punctuate what is otherwise a predominately yellowish white and uninhabited fragment of nature.</p>

<p>為恭は、復古大和絵派の画家の中で、古典的な絵画の復興に、最も熱意を燃やした人物であった。技法を、数百年前の原画を丹念に模写することで習得し、さらに、宮廷の生活、儀式、衣裳の詳しい知識を独学で身につけた。　この絵の完成二ヶ月前に、長年希望していた官位を受けている。<br>幕末の騒乱期、為恭は、絵画の習得のため、幕府要人宅を訪問するところを見咎められ、後に尊皇派に追われ、42歳で暗殺された。&lt;/BIG&gt;</p>
<p>On each of twelve panels of this pair of screens, the ﬁgure of a revered poet from Japan’s classical age is seated, set against a solid gold ground. Attired as if in a formal courtly setting, the women wear the many-layered kimono of the aristocracy of the Heian period (794-1185), while the men sport clothing and lacquered hats of various court ranks. Above each poet is a <em>waka</em> verse that he or she composed, brushed in masterful calligraphy of a general style contemporary with the poet’s lifetime. The relatively large number of female poets depicted may indicate that the screens were commissioned for use in women’s quarters.</p>
<p>Tamechika was perhaps the most earnest of the <em>fukko yamato-e</em> artists who revived classical Japanese painting. Learning this technique required painstaking copying of original, centuries-old works. To this, Tamechika added an extraordinary, self-taught knowledge of court life, ceremonies, and dress. Just two months before this painting was done, Tamechika attained his long-held desire of receiving a court rank himself.<br>On the brink of Japan’s imperial restoration, Tamechika was seen visiting the home of a top shogunal official where he was studying works of art, and ironically, was later tracked down and assassinated, at the age of 42, by proimperialists.</p>

The flowers of spring—tree peony, spring cymbidium, astor, peach, iris, and rose—flow into summer, beginning with the white magnolia (<em>yulan</em>) and crab apple (<em>haitang</em>). Together, these last two flowers comprise a rebus or visual pun for the auspicious phrase “yutang fugui:” “wealth and rank in the Jade Hall.” The Jade Hall alludes to the Hanlin Academy, a government bureau where esteemed scholars were appointed to compile documents for the imperial court.  The opening section shown here depicts the first three flowers of spring.</p>

He specialized in naturalistic depictions of peasant life, including this compassionate rendering of a Dutch woman and her child. Melchers portrayed the pair with vivid intensity, contrasting the mother’s direct gaze with the charming appeal of the baby’s chubby face. The rapid brushwork used to describe the clothing and the swaddling blanket contributes to the freshness of his depiction. In 1906 <em>Mother and Child</em> was exhibited at both the Paris Salon and the Art Institute.</p>

The depiction of figures gazing out from two water pavilions at the foot of a rocky outcrop—as well as a dramatic clusters of old pine-trees and billowing, restless forms of mountain-ridges that rise from valleys into the high distance—are all features associated with Guo Xi’s iconic landscapes. The relatively looser composition and hybrid brushwork, however, point to a Yuan re-interpretation of this Northern Song style.  A seal on the painting that may be associated with a Yuan scholar named Wu Fang supports this fourteenth-century date.</p>

Their familial pose and other details, such as the woman’s gold ring and the red mark on the girl’s hand, invite speculation as to their relationship to each other and to the artist. Technical analysis has revealed that Paul Gauguin reworked the position of the woman’s hands to align diagonally with those of the young girl standing behind her. Together, they form an upward axis reinforced by the cat, also a later addition.</p>

The ﬁgure, placed parallel to the picture plane and silhouetted against the bright blue of the sky, evokes antique relief sculpture. Her white cotton dress was the fashionable attire of middle- and upper-class women in the 1790s, its antique associations reﬂecting Neoclassical ideals and its simplicity echoing the egalitarian spirit of the new French Republic. Constance Pipelet, later Constance de Salm-Dyck, was a noted poet, librettist, and feminist with a salon that attracted the literary and artistic notables of Paris.</p>

The Petite Creuse River,"Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1889,1889.0,1889.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>Claude Monet began this canvas—one of three of the Petite Creuse—in April 1889 but only returned to it later that spring, by which time the landscape had changed considerably. The oak tree, for example, was sprouting leaves, obscuring the view he had already established. Rather than rework or restart the canvas to depict the current season, Monet hired workers to defoliate the tree so that he could re-create its earlier appearance.</p>
<p>Monet spent three months in the remote Creuse valley in central France beginning in early March 1889 after visiting the region for a few days with art critic Gustave Geffroy in February. Despite bouts of poor health and bad weather, he returned to Giverny having painted 24 canvases. These constituted the artist’s first planned and rigorously defined series of paintings.</p>

The elegant figures in <em>Pastoral Gathering</em> are grouped to suggest the three phases of love: childhood innocence (left), romantic enchantment and courtship (center), and amorous attainment (right). The transitory nature of romance is underscored by the changing autumn leaves and waning afternoon light. This painting may have been begun by Watteau toward the end of his career and finished by Jean-Baptiste Pater, who studied under Watteau and completed some of his unfinished projects.</p>

Mynah and Lotus 鷯哥荷花圖,"Ren Yi (Chinese, 1840–1895)","Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1885",1885.0,1885.0,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Painting,ARTIC-20727,China,"<p>Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School.  Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.</p>
<p>The mynah bird, known for its perfect imitation of the human voice, was a favorite subject of the influential 17th-century painter Zhu Da (Bada Shanren). Known for his highly individualistic style, Zhu Da was particularly influential among Shanghai painters. The black form of the mynah was ideal for the expressive brushwork known as <em>xieyi</em> (“sketch conceptualism”); and for Zhu Da, the mynah was imbued with a cryptic, highly personal symbolic power. It is unclear whether Ren Yi consciously accessed Zhu Da’s symbolic usage of the bird as a rebuke of Chinese society in this painting. However, as indicated in the inscription, which states that the painting was a gift for a friend and antique shop owner, Ren Yi consciously “imitated” Zhu Da’s style as a tribute to the artist.</p>

The lunette <em>A Glimpse into Hell, or Fear</em> is drawn from 14th-century poet Dante Alighieri’s <em>Inferno</em>, the first part of his epic poem, <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Here, five females confront the gate of Hell. Beholding such a sight, they express apprehension and fear, accentuated by the swirling forms of their draperies and hair. Vedder focused on the figures’ psychological tension, rather than the spectacle of the environs itself, depicting only a sliver of fiery flames at bottom left.</p>

Two figures on the right play tambourines, quintessential instruments of southern Italian folk music. With its rounded shape encircled by metal jingles, the tambourine represented for local audiences the sun and its rays spreading light and heat throughout the region. In the foreground a spaniel dog with a large, glassy eye stares out at the viewer like a reproachful commentator on his human companions’ unbridled folly.</p>
<p><em>Springtime and Love</em> was shown at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878 and in 1893 at the Chicago World’s Fair (also known as the Columbian Exposition). It entered the museum’s permanent collection eight years later.</p>

Saint John the Baptist Entering the Wilderness,"Giovanni di Paolo (Italian, 1398-1482)",1455/60,1455.0,1460.0,Tempera on panel,Painting,ARTIC-6656,Italy,"<p>This is one of <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=panel&categoryQuery=di+Paolo&artist_ids=Giovanni+di+Paolo"">six paintings</a> illustrating scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, a prophet considered a forerunner of Jesus. They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.</p>

In his early still lifes, such as this one, he incorporated motifs common to 17th-century Dutch and Flemish works: the foreshortened knife, the handle of which protrudes over the table’s edge; the overturned glass; and the remains of a meal.

I'timad-ud-Daula's Tomb at Agra,India (Agra),c. 1820,1815.0,1825.0,"Watercolor on paper watermarked J. Whatman with pencil, pen, ink and gold",Painting,,India,"<p>This architectural rendering of a magnificent tomb at Agra provides an accurate depiction of the <em>pietra dura</em> inlays and carved marble jali screens of the mausoleum built by the Mughal empress Nur Jahan in honor of her father, Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who rose to become the prime minister under the emperor Jahangir (r. 1605–27) and held the exalted title I’timad-ud-Daula (Pillar of the Empire). The powerful Nur Jahan had immense financial resources at her disposal. Built between 1622 and 1628 and modest in size, as befitted the mausoleum of a nobleman rather than an emperor, the structure is lavish in its use of semiprecious stones, and the workmanship and design are of unsurpassed quality. In its exclusive use of white marble, it antedates the Taj Mahal and is considered by many to be the finer monument.</p>
<p>This drawing was created in the Company style, named after the British East India Company, which spearheaded English mercantile and political interests in the subcontinent from the early seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century. The British were eager to record and catalogue everything they saw. In the absence of photography, first British and later Indian artists, who excelled in drawing and painting fine details, recorded the sights. The style arose in the later part of the eighteenth century and ended in the mid-nineteenth with the beginning of photography. In addition to architectural drawings, other subjects included animal and botanical studies, occupations and trades, regional dress, festivals, and scenes of village life.</p>

Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. <em>The Child’s Bath</em> is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt’s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.</p>
","Known for her sensitive yet unsentimental scenes of women and children, Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to exhibit with the original French Impressionist group. In <em>The Child’s Bath</em>, one of her masterworks, she used cropped forms, bold patterns and outlines, and a flattened perspective, all of which she derived from her study of Japanese woodblock prints.<",100.3 × 66.1 cm (39 1/2 × 26 in.),ARTIC-5de963b1-55e2-b349-6cd5-85f9bd2687ec,https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/5de963b1-55e2-b349-6cd5-85f9bd2687ec/full/max/0/default.jpg

Quiet Life in a Wooded Glen 林麓幽居圖,"Wang Meng 王蒙 (Chinese, c. 1308-1385)","Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), dated 1361",1361.0,1361.0,Hanging scroll; ink and light colors on paper,Painting,ARTIC-27934,China,"<p>This modest cottage nestled at the foot of towering mountains presents a quintessential image of academic retreat from the “dusty” world of material concerns and political instabilities. Its cultured occupant kneels on a platform and plays the zither (<em>qin</em>); a book lies open before him and young servants wait attentively nearby. The luxuriant setting of layered peaks and intertwined trees, as well as the dry, charcoal- like treatment of fibrous and dotted boulders, is imbued with a textural richness. This style is closely associated with Wang Meng, the last of the “Four Great Masters” of the Yuan dynasty.</p>
<p>Such a complex, kinetic composition reflects this artist's distinctive contribution to the literati's new use of painting as a vehicle for intellectual and emotional self-expression.  This concept was largely kindled by social and political upheavals that accompanied the 14th-century Mongol conquest of China and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. Wang Meng, who had served the Mongol government as a legal scribe, retired to a mountain hermitage in the turbulent final decades of Yuan rule. He may have executed this painting as a metaphorical self-portrait.</p>

The work is one of a number of small figure paintings by Jean-Antoine Watteau in which the subject’s clothing was inspired by contemporary theater. Here, the woman wears a pseudo-Turkish costume, which reflects the Western European vogue for Turkish culture (“turquerie”) at that time.

In the middle of a wedding celebration, the goddess of discord, Eris, has thrown a golden apple into the feast to provoke jealousy. She succeeds in igniting a competition for the extraordinary fruit between Venus, goddess of beauty, who sits nude in the foreground; Juno, goddess of marriage, who wears a flowing veil at the center; and Minerva, goddess of war, who stands at the left in a helmet. Rubens humanized the gods through robust modeling of their bodies and facial expressions, a choice appropriate to the subject matter, a story of their pride and vanity.</p>

John Singer Sargent painted this portrait during his first extended stay in Venice as a professional artist. Rather than a formal commission, the work likely served as a souvenir of friendship and shared experiences. Its relatively small scale and the background’s thin, quick brushwork suggest that Sargent completed the canvas in a single sitting. The painting’s dark tones and limited palette are reminiscent of Spanish masters such as Diego Velázquez, whom Sargent looked to in particular during his student years in the late 1870s, and indeed throughout his career.</p>

Beata Beatrix,"Dante Gabriel Rossetti (English, 1828-1882)",1871/72,1871.0,1872.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36457,England,"<p>Both a poet and a painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a circle of Victorian artists who were united in their regard for medieval aesthetics. Named after the thirteenth-century poet Dante Alighieri, Rossetti found inspiration for <em>Beata Beatrix</em> in his namesake’s <em>La vita nuova (The New Life</em>; 1295). Rossetti’s scene draws a parallel between Dante’s love for the late Beatrice and his own affection for his recently deceased wife and muse, Elizabeth Siddal. While this picture is a tribute to Siddal, Rossetti was adamant that it does not represent her death. Rather, the work portrays her as if in a trance or altered spiritual state.</p>
<p>Rossetti’s symbolism combines details from his personal life with those from <em>La Vita Nuova</em>. “The Dove” was the artist’s nickname for Siddal, and a haloed dove delivers her a white poppy, a symbol of laudanum—a derivative of opium—which caused her death by overdose. Above rises the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge that served as the setting of Dante’s poem. To the upper left is the personification of Love and to the right the figure of Dante, who doubles as a representation of Rossetti himself. The sundial shadows the number nine, the age Dante first saw Beatrice as well as the hour and day of her death. Rossetti designed the frame, and at the top right he inscribed, “How doth the city sit solitary.” This quote from <em>La Vita Nuova</em> refers to the city of Florence’s mourning of Beatrice.</p>
<p>Given the deeply personal nature of the work, Rossetti initially refused his patron William Graham’s request to create a replica, although he eventually yielded. The Art Institute’s painting is this second version, which is the only one to have a predella—the painted scene at the bottom of the frame—depicting Beatrice and Dante’s reunion in paradise. With this addition, Rossetti provides the medieval love story with a happy conclusion, perhaps suggesting that he, too, had begun to come to terms with his own profound grief.</p>

He painted a series of cottages— including this painting—based on his walks through the village. He described this series to his brother: “I feel for the brood and the nests—particularly those human nests, those cottages on the heath and their inhabitants.” Van Gogh carefully infused the woman, the cottage, and the setting with the same earthy tones and the loose, directional texture of the brushstrokes. In doing so, he emphasized the way she belonged to this place, and it to her.</p>

Spring Arriving in the Han Palace 漢宮春曉圖,"Yuan Jiang 袁江 (Chinese, active c. 1690–1724)","Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1717",1712.0,1722.0,Hanging scroll; ink and slight color on silk,Painting,ARTIC-60977,China,"<p>Yuan Jiang is most renowned for his meticulous “ruled-line painting” (<em>jiehua</em>) of architecture—the only pictorial style to utilize carpentry tools along with the flexible brush. A master of composition as well as draftsmanship, Yuan seamlessly constructed buildings within landscapes of imposing grandeur and unexpected drama. This aristocratic villa and its surrounding garden of large, diagonally swept trees and huge, eroded rocks lies beneath distant mountain ranges that emerge and recede above a thick mist. Within this animated and dreamlike setting, figures in the foreground library, on the veranda, and in the surrounding garden appear isolated in their own tranquility. Such strikingly panoramic but personally accessible images were typically commissioned by affluent individuals of late imperial China for display in the spacious reception halls of their private mansions.</p>

The figures in the center personify the three plastic arts: architecture, painting, and sculpture. They are surrounded by the nine muses of Classical antiquity.</p>
<p>The scene’s subdued, chalky colors and overall flatness recall Roman wall paintings. Indeed, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes was the leading muralist in France when he first displayed this painting at the 1884 Salon, a state-sponsored art exhibition; this canvas is itself a smaller version of a mural he made for the stairway of the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, France.

The two women in this somber, unfinished painting were identified through preparatory drawings that label them as “Mme Lisle” (left) and “Mme Loubens” (right). Both were friends of artist <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/35577/edouard-manet"">Édouard Manet’s</a> family; they likely met Degas at a gathering at Manet’s home.

Along the riverbank, a boatman poised with paddle in hand stands tall in anticipation of launching. Nearby, scholars wearing black hats linger over their departure. Within the thatched pavilion, two servants diligently pack up the remains of a farewell party. In ancient China, a handscroll would be viewed by unrolling it in segments, one arm’s length at a time, from right to left. This handscroll would thus gradually reveal the travelers and the distant landscape, creating the effect of sending them off.</p>

"Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare","Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1877,1877.0,1877.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>The Impressionists frequently paid tribute to the modern aspects of Paris. Their paintings abound with scenes of grand boulevards and elegant, new blocks of buildings, as well as achievements of modern construction such as iron bridges, exhibition halls, and train sheds. <em>Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare</em> was an especially appropriate choice of subject for Claude Monet in the 1870s. The terminal, linking Paris and Normandy, where Monet’s technique of painting outdoors had been nurtured in the 1860s, was also the point of departure for towns and villages to the west and north of Paris frequented by the Impressionists. Monet completed eight of his twelve known paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in time for the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, probably placing them in the same gallery.</p>
<p>Monet chose to focus his attention here on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artificial and natural effects: the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure, and daylight penetrating the large, glazed sections of the roof. Monet’s depictions of the station inaugurated what was to become for him an established pattern of painting a specific motif repeatedly in order to capture subtle and temporal atmospheric changes. But the series also represented his last attempt to deal with urban realities: from this point on in his career, Monet would be largely a painter of landscapes.</p>

The infant gives Saint Dominic a rosary; the saint had founded a preaching order that was closely associated with the use of the rosary as a spiritual exercise. The embroidered decorative scenes on the altar cloth depict the mysteries of the rosary, key events in the lives of Mary and Jesus. The devout believer would have meditated on these images while repeating the cycle of prayers marked by rosary beads.</p>

Rhythmically arranged in groups of two and three, the figures appear more as symbolic forms than as portraits of individuals.

<p>Unlike his other Tahitian-inspired landscapes, this painting was produced in Paris shortly after Paul Gauguin’s first trip to the island. Drawn from fantasy and memory, the psychedelic composition is one of the most abstract and avant-garde works of the artist’s career.</p>

Here he looked to the 17th-century Baroque artist Diego Velázquez, whose two paintings of world-weary philosophers (<em>Aesop</em> and <em>Menippus</em>, both c. 1638) Manet had admired that year at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. Like Velázquez’s representation of the ancient stoics (whose poverty is associated with wisdom), Manet’s beggar-philosophers fit into the popular notion of the social outcast as a seer possessing rare insight.</p>
<p>This painting and <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/95183""><em>Beggar with a Duffle Coat</em></a> were probably conceived as companion pieces.</p>

A solitary female figure seated at right almost goes unnoticed amid the long, horizontal bands of earth and water. It is the expansive sky that dominates the composition, suggestive of a spiritual force in nature. Kensett, who first trained as an engraver, applied draftsman’s precision to his paintings of the American landscape. <em>Near Newport</em> hints at the tourist activities that would come to define the town in the late 19th century, with couples walking along the distant shore and bathing tents dotting the horizon.</p>

The young woman’s black dress, solemn disposition, and wedding ring signal a state of mourning. A church steeple in the background symbolizes her faith and purity, while the vegetation and stonework in the foreground suggest that she stands near her loved one’s grave. The golden lighting, low vantage point, and the figure’s windblown hair contribute to the air of introspection. Executed just after the Civil War, <em>Love’s Melancholy</em> resonated with the American public, who likely came to know the painting through a color reproduction that was produced and distributed by 1869.</p>

Their symbolic tools—spindle, distaff, and shears—rest in the foreground, emphasizing the Fates’ decisive role in matters of life and death. Vedder adapted this painting from an illustration he had designed for an 1884 publication by Edward FitzGerald—a translation of the work of 11th-century poet Omar Khayyám, <em>The Rubáiyát</em>.

Distant View of Niagara Falls,"Thomas Cole (American, born England, 1801–1848)",1830,1830.0,1830.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-34007,Niagara Falls,"<p>Thomas Cole visited Niagara Falls in May 1829, composing this romanticized, autumnal scene the following year. Portraying the grandeur of the American landscape, the artist omitted the factories, scenic overlooks, and hotels that populated the area in the early 19th century. Cole expressed concern about the environmental impact of voracious industrialism, but at the same time his painting erased the human devastation wrought by colonialism and conquest in the region, which encompassed Attiwonderonk, Haudenosaunee, and Wenrohronon lands. The two Native American figures at center, combined with the falls, identify the setting as North America, but their diminished presence in scale and number reinforces the false idea of the “vanishing Indian” and is meant to signal impending transformation rather than acknowledge their stolen sovereignty.</p>

Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>

The Fountains,"Hubert Robert (French, 1733-1808)",1787/88,1787.0,1788.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-36407,France,"<p>The painting of Classical ruins had reached the zenith of its popularity when Hubert Robert, the leading French practitioner of this specialty, was commissioned in 1787 to paint a suite of four canvases for a wealthy financier’s château at Méréville, near Paris. <em>The Fountains</em> and its companion pieces were set into the paneled walls of a salon in the château, creating an alternate space that played off of the elegant, Neoclassical decor of the room. Robert has studied in Rome from 1754 to 1765 and there had gleaned his artistic vocabulary. Like the other three large paintings from the group painted for Méréville, all in the Art Institute, <em>The Fountains</em> exploits Robert’s typical vocabulary of fictive niches, arches, coffered vaults, colonnades, majestic stairwells, and Roman statuary to create a fantasy of expansive space. The four paintings are inhabited by tiny figures in the foreground; these serve only to set the scale and animate the scene, for the ruins themselves are the true subject of the pictures. In his use of ruins, Robert embodied the notion of the relationship of mankind and the built environment to nature that was expressed by the French philosopher and encyclopedist Denis Diderot: “Everything vanishes, everything dies, only time endures.”</p>

In this lyrical late work by Botticelli, two angels draw back curtains to reveal the Virgin and Child, who are framed by slender trees in a setting suggesting a throne. The intimate presentation of the holy figures and Christ’s gesture of blessing suggest that this small painting served a private devotional function. This supposition is supported by the choice of format, since a Florentine patron would have typically commissioned a circular painting, or tondo, for use in a bedchamber.</p>

The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>

For the next three years, Wollaston worked in New York, executing numerous portraits for area sitters eager to acquire quality likenesses from a skilled, European-trained artist—a rarity in mid-18th-century America. Wollaston rendered his figures with convincing modeling and forms, excelling in the depiction of colorful draperies. In <em>Portrait of a Young Man</em>, as in his other works of the time, the artist employed formulaic poses, gestures, and dress, a result, in part, of looking to English sources for portraiture, but also a means of meeting the many requests for commissions. Beginning in 1753, Wollaston painted in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina.</p>

"Virgil Reading the ""Aeneid"" to Augustus, Octavia, and Livia","Jean Baptiste Joseph Wicar (French, 1762-1834)",1790/93,1790.0,1790.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-42368,France,"<p>In the late 18th century, the French Academy promoted a severely Classical approach to history painting as a means to regenerate art—and in contrast to the perceived decadence of the Rococo style. Jacques-Louis David and his students were leading exponents of this Neoclassical approach, treating antique subjects as moral exemplars for contemporary audiences. Here, David’s student Jean-Baptiste Wicar depicted the response of the Roman emperor Augustus and his family to Virgil’s reading of his epic poem the Aeneid, which tells the story of Aeneas, the Trojan prince who settled in Latium after many adventures and was viewed as an ancestor of Augustus. The emotionally charged gestures of Augustus and his sister Octavia suggest that they identify their own family drama with the heroic events recounted by Virgil.</p>

Celebrated in his own time, Botticelli developed a distinctly sentimental and tactile style of painting for both religious and secular subjects.",85.8 × 59.1 cm (33 3/4 × 23 1/4 in.),ARTIC-b59cc3e9-a7c0-5aa1-1a22-bb472bb2e6d4,https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/b59cc3e9-a7c0-5aa1-1a22-bb472bb2e6d4/full/max/0/default.jpg

The Crucifixion,"Carlo Crivelli (Italian, 1430/35-1495)",c. 1487,1482.0,1492.0,Tempera on panel,Painting,ARTIC-37454,Italy,"<p>The Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist gaze in anguish at Jesus on the cross. Carlo Crivelli enhanced the morbidness of the scene by depicting Jesus as emaciated and puffy-eyed, his mouth agape, with blood dripping from his wounds. As subtle hints towards his eventual victory over death, wind animates his loincloth and inflates the sail of a boat in the distance, while verdant plants shoot up from cracks in the rocky, arid terrain. Crivelli’s unique style, vividly graphic and marrying the beautiful with the grotesque, has long captivated audiences.</p>

Group Pilgrimage to the Jizo Nun,"Ike Taiga (Japanese, 1723-1776)",1755/65,1750.0,1770.0,Hanging scroll; ink on paper,Painting,ARTIC-25418,Japan,"<p>Ike Taiga was a revolutionary known for revitalizing Japanese painting traditions in the eighteenth century. He infused the Chinese-inspired ink painting (<em>nanga</em>) that was gaining favor among intellectuals in Kyoto with a purely Japanese aesthetic and humor. <em>Group Pilgrimage to the Jizo Nun</em> is a snapshot of contemporary life in Japan presented from Taiga’s unique perspective. The print depicts pilgrims making offerings to the Jizo nun, a holy woman believed to be able to communicate with the bodhisattva Jizo, who had the power to save souls in the afterlife.</p>
<p><em>Group Pilgrimage</em> contains an inscription relating the story of the Jizo nun. Taiga was a master calligrapher, poet, and seal carver and was well versed in all forms of writing, from ancient seal script to cursive kana. Here he rendered the inscription in a cursive, informal style very much in keeping with the spontaneity of the painting itself. Taiga was also renowned for his use of finger painting and other odd techniques. Although opinions vary as to whether or not this work is a finger painting, it is clear that Taiga did not use a traditional brush. It seems likely that this could be a “paper twist painting,” in which the artist worked with scraps of twisted paper charged with ink.</p>

The Capture of Samson,"Peter Paul Rubens (Flemish, 1577-1640)",1609–10,1609.0,1610.0,Oil on panel,Painting,ARTIC-36487,Flanders,"<p>This panel, made as a sketch for a larger painting com- missioned by the mayor of Antwerp, Nicolas Rockox, demonstrates the influence of the ancient and modern art Peter Paul Rubens studied in Italy. The subject comes from a story in the Hebrew Bible in which the mighty Samson awakes to find that his lover, Delilah, has cut off his hair, the source of his strength. Rubens drew from ancient Roman sculpture for Samson’s contorted pose as he is captured by soldiers, while the strong contrast of light and dark recalls the work of 16th-century Italian painter <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/26267/tintoretto"">Tintoretto</a>—for example, <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64920/tarquin-and-lucretia""><em>Tarquin and Lucretia</em></a>.</p>

In this scene of domestic life, Van Mieris deftly translated highlights on the cane bassinet and ceramic pitcher on the table with the tip of his brush.

Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer),"Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926)",1890/91,1891.0,1891.0,Oil on canvas,Painting,ARTIC-35809,France,"<p>The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be""><em>Stacks of Wheat</em></a> rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s <em>Stacks of Wheat</em> in the world.</p>

<p>Blackburn shaped his career around the Atlantic trade networks developed in the 18th century. Probably trained in London, he traveled to Bermuda in 1752, securing commissions there. Two years later he was in Newport, where he painted Abigail as well as her stepmother. Blackburn moved on to paint portraits in Boston and Portsmouth before returning to England in 1764.</p>
