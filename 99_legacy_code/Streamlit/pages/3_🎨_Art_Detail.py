Noteworthy is the naturalism of the Child's body and the sense of weight as He leans on the Madonna's lap, demonstrating Gozzoli's skill in rendering the human form with a sense of three-dimensionality. His positioning and the halo around His head are indicative of the centrality of divine figures in religious Renaissance art. The delicate details, like the fine lines of the hair and the soft modeling of the flesh, along with the use of gold to denote holiness, reflect Gozzoli's finesse and the fine aesthetics of the time. The rich colors and the attention to textural details, like the translucency of the fabric, show Gozzoli's attention to both human form and the adornment of his subjects.''')
